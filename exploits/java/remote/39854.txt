Vulnerability description:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The PowerFolder server and client are written in Java. Data exchange is mainly
done via serialized objects that are send over a dedicated port (TCP port 1337).
This service allows deserialization of untrusted data, which can be exploited to
execute arbitrary code.[1][2]

The tested PowerFolder version contains a modified version of the Java
library "ApacheCommons". In this version, the PowerFolder developers removed
certain dangerous classes like
org.apache.commons.collections.functors.InvokerTransformer
however, exploitation is still possible using another gadget chain [3].

Proof of concept:
