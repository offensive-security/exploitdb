Vulnerability Details

Jenkins is vulnerable to a Java deserialization vulnerability. In order to trigger the vulnerability two requests need to be sent.

The vulnerability can be found in the implementation of a bidirectional communication channel (over HTTP) which accepts commands.

The first request starts a session for the bi-directional channel and is used for “downloading” data from the server. The HTTP header “Session” is the identifier for the channel. The HTTP header “Side” specifies the “downloading/uploading” direction.

The second request is the sending component of the bidirectional channel. The first requests is blocked until the second request is sent. The request for a bidirectional channel is matched by the “Session” HTTP header which is just a UUID.


Proof of Concept

In order to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to create a serialized payload with the command to execute by running the payload.jar script.

The second step is to change python script jenkins_poc1.py:
- Adjust target url in URL variable
- Change file to open in line “FILE_SER = open(“jenkins_poc1.ser”, “rb”).read()” to your payload file.
