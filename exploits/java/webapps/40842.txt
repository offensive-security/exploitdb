(#05, 23/11/2016)           Data Security Division

         Title:	Red Hat JBoss EAP deserialization of untrusted data
   Application:	JBoss EAP 5.2.X and prior versions
   Description:	The application server deserializes untrusted data via the
                JMX Invoker Servlet. This can lead to a DoS via resource
                exhaustion and potentially remote code execution.

 Vendor Status: Will not fix
 CVE Candidate: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned
                the name CVE-2016-7065 to this issue.

1. Abstract.

JBoss EAP's JMX Invoker Servlet is exposed by default on port 8080/TCP. The
communication employs serialized Java objects, encapsulated in HTTP
requests and responses.

The server deserializes these objects without checking the object type. This
behavior can be exploited to cause a denial of service and potentially
execute arbitrary code.

The objects that can cause the DoS are based on known disclosed payloads
taken from:

- https://gist.github.com/coekie/a27cc406fc9f3dc7a70d

Currently there is no known chain that allows code execution on JBoss EAP,
however new chains are discovered every day.

2. Example Attack Session.

Submit an authenticated POST request to the JMX Invoker Servlet URL (for
example: http://localhost:8080/invoker/JMXInvokerServlet) with one of the
following objects in the body of the request:

    * 01_BigString_limited.ser: it's a string object; the server will
      reply in a normal way (object size similar to the next one).
    * 02_SerialDOS_limited.ser: the application server will require
      about 2 minutes to execute the request with 100% CPU usage.
    * 03_BigString.ser: it's a string object; the server will
      reply in a normal way (object size similar to the next one).
    * 04_SerialDOS.ser: the application server will require an
      unknown amount of time to execute the request with 100% CPU usage.

3. Affected Platforms.

This vulnerability affects versions 4 and 5 of JBoss EAP.

4. Fix.

Red Hat will not fix the issue because JBoss EAP 4 is out of maintenance
support and JBoss EAP 5 is close to the end of its maintenance period.

5. Proof Of Concept.

See jboss_payload.zip (40842.zip) and Example Attack Session above.
