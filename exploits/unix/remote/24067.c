LHA has been reported prone to multiple vulnerabilities that may allow a malicious archive to execute arbitrary code or corrupt arbitrary files when the archive is operated on.

The first issues reported have been assigned the CVE candidate identifier (CAN-2004-0234). LHA is reported prone to two stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerabilities. An attacker may exploit these vulnerabilities to execute supplied instructions with the privileges of the user who invoked the affected LHA utility.

The second set of issues has been assigned CVE candidate identifier (CAN-2004-0235). In addition to the buffer-overflow vulnerabilities that were reported, LHA has been reported prone to several directory-traversal issues. An attacker may likely exploit these directory-traversal vulnerabilities to corrupt/overwrite files in the context of the user who is running the affected LHA utility.

**NOTE: Reportedly, this issue may also cause a denial-of-service condition in the ClearSwift MAILsweeper products due to code dependency.

**Update: Many F-Secure Anti-Virus products are also reported prone to the buffer-overflow vulnerability.

  Bug Found By : Ulf Ha"rnhammar <Ulf.Harnhammar.9485@student.uu.se>

LHa buffer overflows and directory traversal problems


PROGRAM: LHa (Unix version)
VENDOR: various people
VULNERABLE VERSIONS: 1.14d to 1.14i            // Theze sectionz completely taken from full-disclosure :))
                     1.17 (Linux binary)
                     possibly others
IMMUNE VERSIONS: 1.14i with my patch applied
                 1.14h with my patch applied

Patch : Ulf Ha"rnhammar made some patch U can find it on :
          LHa 1.14: http://www2m.biglobe.ne.jp/~dolphin/lha/lha.htm
	  http://www2m.biglobe.ne.jp/~dolphin/lha/prog/
          LHa 1.17: http://www.infor.kanazawa-it.ac.jp/~ishii/lhaunix/


---------------------------------------------------------------

Little Explanation about Exploit : Copy the attached overflow.lha file to your directory , i.e /home
Then open overflow.lha with text editor(vim is better), U will see there four bytes XXXX at the end of the line, just
delete XXXX and paste your ASCII RET address there,but make sure not to malform the file.Then run the sploit.

Note : overflow.lha file is completely taken from Ulf's post.

Demo:

addicted@labs:~/c-hell$ ./lha /home/addicted/overflow.lha
