| OVERVIEW |
+----------+

The release of this advisory provides exploitation details in relation to a
known patched vulnerability in Apple Safari.   These details were obtained
through the Packet Storm Bug Bounty program and are being released to the
community.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------+
| DETAILS |
+---------+

The heap memory buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the WebKit's
JavaScriptCore JSArray::sort(...) method.  This method accepts the user-defined
JavaScript function and calls it from the native code to compare array items.
If this compare function reduces array length, then the trailing array items
will be written outside the "m_storage->m_vector[]" buffer, which leads to the
heap memory corruption.

The exploit for this vulnerability is a JavaScript code which shows how to
use it for memory corruption of internal JS objects (Unit32Array and etc.)
and subsequent arbitrary code execution (custom ARM/x64 payloads can be pasted
into the JS code).
