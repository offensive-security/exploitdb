Common Vulnerability Scoring System:
====================================
6.7


Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Using this app, you can download videos to a PC or a smartphone from your iPhone through WiFi. The video downloaded can be played back
on PC and another smart phones as well as Mac and iPhone because the app converts it into a MP4 video. It only takes a few seconds for
the conversion. You would say it is the fastest. Just run the app on the iPhone and open the web browser on your PC or Android. That is
all that you are required to do. It is quite simple. In addition to the web browser, a ftp client application is also supported to
access the videos. Do not pay money for these functions as the app provides all of them without charging.

Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A directory traversal web vulnerability has been discovered in the official BlueFinger Apps Video WiFi Transfer v1.01 iOS mobile application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the path restriction of a service to access sensitive app-, web-server or -device information.

The vulnerability is located in the `ftp` (ftp://localhost:8080) service of the wifi `web-server` module. The issue allows an attacker to bypass
the regular `folder/path` validation mechnism to access sensitive app web-server or iOS -device information. The attack vector of the issue is on
the application-side of the service and to perform malicious request the `GET method` is required to use.

After the start of the web-server by usage of the ftp function, the attacker is able to include 5 more path values (../../../../../) to access
unauthorized higher folders outside the mobile application service. In the analysis we saw that the path change of 5 directories is required
to bypass. During the tests we accessed the full app service folder and through the directory traversal to web-server configuration files but
also the parent device directory.

The security risk of the directory traversal web vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system)
count of 6.7. Exploitation of the path traversal web vulnerability requires no privileged web-application user account or user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the directory traversal vulnerability results in mobile application or connected device component compromise.

Request Method(s):
			[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
			[+] Directory

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
			[+] path

Affected Module(s):
			[+] Parent Directory (ftp://localhost:8080/)


Note: The structure of the software is the same like in the official BlueFinger Apps `Photo` WiFi Transfer v1.01 iOS mobile application.
The same vulnerability is located in both mobile ios software of the bluefinger apps company.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The directory traversal web vulnerability can be exploited by attackers without privileged application user account and user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Note: The traversal becomes visible after the 5th path/folder request and affects like regular the full app path via web-server. (_eTiGb+6)
The issue is the same vulnerability like in the VL-ID 1286. The producer only changed the software name and converter to ensure that
video can be transfered then pictures.


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The directory traversal web vulnerability can be patched by a secure filter and restriction mechanism in the GET method request of the directory/path name value module.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the directory traversal web vulnerability in the ftp service of the mobile application is estimated as high.
