==================================
2013-01-28:    Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Apple AppStore
Product: Rambax, LLC - SimplyShare 1.4


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Critical


Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
A critical remote code execution web vulnerability has been discovered in the official SimplyShare v1.4 iOS mobile web-application.
Remote attackers are able to execute own system specific codes to compromise the affected web-application or the connected mobile device.

The remote vulnerability is located in the vulnerable `text` value of the `Send Text` module. Remote attackers can use the prompt send
text input to direct execute system codes or malicious application requests. The send text input field has no restrictions or secure
encoding to ensure direct code executes are prevented. After the inject the code execution occurs directly in the send text module
item list. The security risk of the remote code execution vulnerability is estimated as critical with a cvss (common vulnerability
scoring system) count of 9.2(+)|(-)9.3.

Exploitation of the code execution vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account with password.
Successful exploitation of the remote code execution vulnerability results in mobile application or connected device component compromise.


Request Method(s):
				[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Send Text

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] text

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Access from Computer (Send Text Index List - Text Name & Context)



1.2
A local file/path include web vulnerability has been discovered in the official SimplyShare v1.4 iOS mobile web-application.
The local file include web vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized include local file/path requests or system
specific path commands to compromise the web-application or mobile device.

The local file include web vulnerability is located in the vulnerable `filename` value of the `upload files` module (web-interface).
Remote attackers are able to inject own files with malicious filename to compromise the mobile application. The attack vector is
persistent and the request method is POST. The local file/path include execute occcurs in the main file to path section after the
refresh of the file upload. The security risk of the local file include web vulnerability is estimated as high(+) with a cvss (common
vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.7(+)|(-)7.8.

Exploitation of the local file include web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account with password.
Successful exploitation of the local web vulnerability results in mobile application or connected device component compromise by unauthorized
local file include web attacks.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Input(s):
				[+] Upload Files

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] filename

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Access from Computer (File Dir Index List - Folder/Category to  path=/)



1.3
A local command/path injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official SimplyShare v1.4 iOS mobile web-application.
The vulnerability allows to inject local commands via vulnerable system values to compromise the apple iOS mobile web-application.

The vulnerability is located in the in the title value of the header area. Local attackers are able to inject own script codes
as iOS device name. The execute of the injected script code occurs with persistent attack vector in the header section of the
web interface. The security risk of the command/path inject vulnerabilities are estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability
scoring system) count of 6.2(+)|(-)6.3.

Exploitation of the command/path inject vulnerability requires a local low privileged iOS device account with restricted access
and no direct user interaction. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized execute of system specific
commands or unauthorized path requests.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [GET]

Vulnerable Value(s):
				[+] devicename

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] value to title

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Access from Computer (File Dir Index List) - [Header]




1.4
Multiple persistent input validation web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official SimplyShare v1.4 iOS mobile web-application.
The bug allows remote attackers to implement/inject own malicious persistent script codes to the application-side of the vulnerable app.

The vulnerability is located in the `name` value of the internal photo and video module. The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulation
of the local device album names. After the local attacker with physical access injected the code to the local device foto app menu, he is able
to execute the persistent script codes on the application-side of the mobile app device. The security risk of the persistent script code inject
web vulnerabilities are estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.8(+)|(-)3.9.

Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerabilities requires low user interaction and no privileged web-application user account with a password.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to persistent session hijacking (customers), account steal via persistent web attacks,
persistent phishing or persistent manipulation of module context.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Video Folder Name
				[+] Photos Folder Name

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] album name values

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Access from Computer (Photos & Videos Module)

low or medium user interaction. For security demonstration or to reproduce the persistent vulnerabilities follow the provided steps and information below.

PoC: Albums > name

<div id="albums">
<ul class="column">
<li><div class="block"><a href="/rambax/album/0-x"

			</ul>
		</div>


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
1.1
The first vulnerability can be patched by a secure restriction and encode of the send text input field with the text value parameter.
Ensure the output send text item list module only displays secure parsed, encoded and validated context.

1.2
The second vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the file name value parameter in the Upload File POST method request.

1.3
The third vulnerability can be patched by encoding the header section with the title value parameter to prevent physical command injection attacks.

1.4
Encode the photo album and video names to prevent persistent script code injection attacks by local stored album components of the foto (photo) app.


Security Risk:
==============
1.1
The security risk of the remote code exection vulnerability is estimated as critical.

1.2
The security risk of the local file include web vulnerability is estimated as high(+).

1.3
The security risk of the local command inject web vulnerability is estimated as high(-).

1.4
The security risk of the persistent script code inject web vulnerabilities via POST method request are estimated as medium.
