Details:
========
1.1
A local file include and arbitrary file upload vulnerability is detected in the mobile File Lite 3.3 & 3.5 PRO iOS  app (Apple - iPad|iPhone).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers via POST method to include unauthorized remote files on the affected webserver file system.

Remote attackers can also unauthorized implement mobile webshells by using multiple file extensions (*.php.js.gif) when processing to
upload via POST request method. The attacker uploads a file with a double extension or multiple extensions and access the file in the
secound step by usage of the directory webserver dir listing to compromise the apple iphone or ipad application.

Exploitation of the local file include web vulnerability does not require user interaction and also no application user account.
Successful exploitation of the web vulnerabilities results in app/service manipulation and ipad or iphone compromise via file
include or unauthorized web-server file (webshell) upload attacks.

Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] File Lite 3.3 & 3.5 PRO - ITunes or AppStore (Apple)

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] File Upload

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] filename

Affected Module(s):
				[+] File Dir Index Listing



1.2
A persistent input validation vulnerability is detected in the mobile Wifi Photo Transfer 2.1 & 1.1 Pro app for the apple ipad & iphone.
The bug allows an attacker (remote) to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent) of the app web service.

The vulnerability is located in the index file dir listing module of the webserver (http://localhost:8080/) when processing to display
injected and via POST request method manipulated filenames. The persistent script code will be executed out of the main index file dir
listing module when the service is processing to list the new malicious injected filename as item.

Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires low or medium user interaction without an application user account.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to persistent session hijacking (customers), account steal via persistent web
attacks, persistent phishing or stable (persistent) certificate mail notification context manipulation.

Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] File Lite 3.3 & 3.5 PRO - ITunes or AppStore (Apple)

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] File Upload

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] Name

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Filename - Index File Dir Name Listing


1.3
A client side cross site scripting web vulnerability is detected in the mobile Wifi Photo Transfer 2.1 & 1.1 Pro app for the apple ipad & iphone.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to form manipulated urls to inject script code on client side application requests.

The client side cross site scripting web vulnerability is located in the index section when processing to request the via GET a
manipulated filename (value) as response. The vulnerability occurs when a remote attacker is changing the GET file  request to
own script code.  The request will be executed on client side of the victims browser.

Exploitation of the vulnerability does not require an application user account but low or medium user interaction.
Successful exploitation results in client side cross site requests, unauthorized external redirects, client side phishing,
client side session hijacking and client side module context manipulation.

Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] File Lite 3.3 & 3.5 PRO - ITunes or AppStore (Apple)

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Files - GET Request

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] filename


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
the arbitrary file upload vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without required application user account or user interaction.

Solution:
=========
1.1
Parse the POST method request when processing to upload a file with wrong extension and disallow double extensions.
Restrict the file access of web files like html, php or java-script.
Implement a own exception-handling to prevent again future arbitrary file uploads.

1.2
Restrict the input/output  of the del filename and file input parameter. Encode and parse the output of the both vulnerable values to patch the issue.

1.3
Parse the parameter request with the flag details to fix the vulnerability in the GET request.


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the remote arbitrary file upload vulnerability is estimated as high(-)

1.2
The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability is estimated as medium(+).

1.3
The security risk of the client side cross site scripting vulnerability is estimated as low(+).
