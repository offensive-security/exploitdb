It has been reported that Picophone is prone to a remote buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is due to the application failing to verify the size of user input before storing it in a finite buffer.

Successful exploitation of this issue will cause a denial of service condition to be triggered. The attacker may also leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code; this code would be executed in the security context of the user running the affected process.
