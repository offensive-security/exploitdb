# PoC :
# As you can see when we're type a random password. 
# You'll get an error for an incorrect authentication.
# Now with a simple request, we can bypass the authentication
# and get full access to the printer with ''Management Mode''

1. Go to the following url: http://TargetURL/
2. Click on Management Mode
3. Intercept now the request with Burpsuite and click then on 'Ok'' to
login. And now you have to forward POST /checkLogin.cgi HTTP/1.1 request 
to the GET /portal_top.html HTTP/1.1
