Multiple Vulnerabilities in Intellinet NFC-30IR Network Cameras


ADVISORY
--------

Title: Local File Inclusion in CGI-SCRIPT & Hard-Coded Manufacturer Backdoor
Advisory ID: BITL-17-001
Date published: 2017-04-05
Date of last update: 2017-04-05
Vendors contacted: Intellinet

VULNERABILITY
-------------

Type: Local File Inclusion (LFI)(Authenticated) & Hardcoded Manufacturer Backdoor
Risk/Impact: Access to sensitive files & Access control bypass.
Exploitation Type : Remote
CVE Name: CVE-2017-7461 and CVE-2017-7462

DESCRIPTION
------------

We found two vulnerabilities affecting the Intellinet NFC-30IR Camera with
firmware version LM.1.6.16.05

   1. [CVE-2017-7461] once authenticated as admin:admin, you can read local files
   by requesting the '/cgi-bin/admin/fileread?READ.filePath=<insert here>'

   Instead of the developer using server-side scripts to render information, it takes the
   plain text files and uses /fileread CGI script to simply return the plain text - the
   site then relies on Javascript to "format" the text into something pretty.

   There is no sanitization nor lock-down of what paths that script can read, hence all
   files can be viewed. Interesting files to request are; /etc/passwd; /etc/boa.conf and more.


   2. [CVE-2017-7462] a manufacturer backdoor exists that allows one to access a script
   called '/cgi-bin/mft/manufacture' by authenticating as manufacture:erutcafunam

   This binary has been analyzed before by other vendors. We did not analyze it again as we
   feel this is the same file used in other cameras. Note that the NFC-30IR does NOT have the
   wireless_mft executable.

	The hard-coded manufacturer user:pass is manufacture:erutcafunam as shown in the
	below boa.conf snippet;
	/----
	--snip--
	#ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
	ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/operator/ /opt/cgi/operator/
	ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/view/ /opt/cgi/view/
	ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/admin/ /opt/cgi/admin/
	ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/jpg/ /opt/cgi/jpg/
	ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /opt/cgi/
	ScriptAlias /jpg /opt/cgi/jpg

	# MFT: Specify manufacture commands user name and password
	MFT manufacture erutcafunam

	--snip--
	----/

	This indicates that the camera hardware may be some kind of modified/stripped version
	of a Zavio board.
