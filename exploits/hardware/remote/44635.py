Any authenticated user can modify the configuration for it in a way which allows them to read and append to any file as root. This leads to information disclosure and remote code execution. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE ID: CVE-2018-10123.

This PoC requires Python 3.6 and a module called websocket-client which you can install by evoking pip install websocket-client. Please note that if you wish to use this, you should edit lines 58-61 of the script to include the proper IP, username, password and SSH key. You may also edit line 63 to include your own code for execution.
