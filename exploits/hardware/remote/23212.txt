It has been reported that Cisco LEAP (Lightweight Extensible
Authentication Protocol) is prone to a password disclosure weakness that may allow a remote user to steal user passwords. The issue may be exploited out by brute forcing user passwords using dictionary attacks.

Successful exploitation of this weakness may allow a remote attacker to steal authentication information, potentially allowing for unauthorized network access.
