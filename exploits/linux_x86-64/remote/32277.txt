./brop.rb 127.0.0.1

for remote hosts:
./frag.sh ip
./brop.rb ip

rm state.bin when changing host (or relaunching nginx with canaries)

scan.py will find servers, reading IPs from ips.txt



This is a generic exploit for 64-bit nginx which uses a new attack technique (BROP) that does not rely on a particular target binary.  It will work on any distro and even compiled from source installations.
