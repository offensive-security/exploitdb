| OVERVIEW |
+----------+

The release of this advisory provides exploitation details in relation
a weakness in the Linux ASLR implementation.  The problem appears when
the executable is PIE compiled and it has an address leak belonging to
the executable.

These details were obtained through the Packet Storm Bug Bounty program
and are being released to the community.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------+
| DETAILS |
+---------+

An attacker is able to de-randomize all mmapped areas (libraries, mapped files, etc.)
by knowing only an address belonging to the application and the offset2lib value.
