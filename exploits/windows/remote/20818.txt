Windows 2000 Internet printing ISAPI extension contains msw3prt.dll which handles user requests. Due to an unchecked buffer in msw3prt.dll, a maliciously crafted HTTP .printer request containing approx 420 bytes in the 'Host:' field will allow the execution of arbitrary code. Typically a web server would stop responding in a buffer overflow condition; however, once Windows 2000 detects an unresponsive web server it automatically performs a restart. Therefore, the administrator will be unaware of this attack.

* If Web-based Printing has been configured in group policy, attempts to disable or unmap the affected extension via Internet Services Manager will be overridden by the group policy settings.
