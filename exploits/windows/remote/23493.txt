Jordan Windows Telnet Server has been reported prone to a remote buffer overrun vulnerability. The issue has been reported to present itself when a username of excessive length is supplied to the Telnet server. Due to a lack of bounds checking, when this username is copied into an insufficient reserved buffer in stack-based memory, data that exceeds the size of the buffer will overrun its bounds and corrupt adjacent memory. An attacker may exploit this condition to corrupt a saved instruction pointer for the vulnerable function.
