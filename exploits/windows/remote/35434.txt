WebKit is prone to a cross-domain scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly enforce the same-origin policy.

Successfully exploiting this issue will allow attackers to send the content of arbitrary files from the user's system to a remote server controlled by them. This results in disclosure of potentially sensitive information which may aid in further attacks.
