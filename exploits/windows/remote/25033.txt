greed (Get and Resume Elite Edition) is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The issue is exposed when the client processes GRX file lists. GRX file lists allow file downloads to be scripted. Since GRX file lists may originate from an external or untrusted source, this vulnerability is considered to be remote in nature.

Successful exploitation will result in execution of arbitrary code in the context of the application.
