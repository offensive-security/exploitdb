A vulnerability has been reported in Microsoft Windows XP that may cause malicious code to run in the context of the currently logged-in user. The flaw exists in Windows Explorer and may allow executable content that is referenced from inside a folder to run automatically when the folder is accessed.

This vulnerability poses a security risk since users assume that opening a folder is a safe action and that executable content cannot be run when a folder is accessed. Additionally, attackers may be able to exploit this issue remotely if the malicious folder is accessed from an SMB share.

The reporter of this issue has provided a proof-of-concept exploit that executes NetMeeting and installs a keylogger on a vulnerable system.
