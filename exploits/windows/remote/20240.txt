Due to a flaw in the method Microsoft Windows Media Player 7 handles OCX controls (ActiveX containers) in embedded in RTF email messages, it is possible to crash RTF-enabled email clients such as Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express. While this vulnerability lies in the OCX control implementation in Windows Media Player 7, it only affects RTF-enabled email clients.

If a user of Outlook or Outlook Express were to receive an RTF email containing an embedded OCX control associated with Windows Media Player 7, the client would fail when the message was closed. Restarting the application would be required in order to regain normal functionality. In addition, deleting the offending email would resume normal operations of the email client. The functionality of Windows Media Player 7 would not be affected in any way.
