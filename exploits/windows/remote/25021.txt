abcpp is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is exposed when the program is used to handle directives in ABC music notation files. Since the ABC files may originate from an external or untrusted source, this issue is considered remote in nature.

Successful exploitation will result in execution of arbitrary code in the context of the user running the application.
