Reportedly, an attacker can carry out attacks using directory-traversal strings. These issues occur when the application processes malicious archives.

A successful attack can allow the attacker to place potentially malicious files and to overwrite files on a computer in the context of the user running the affected application. A successful exploit may aid in further attacks.

This issue affects MagicISO version 5.0 Build 0166; other versions may also be affected.
