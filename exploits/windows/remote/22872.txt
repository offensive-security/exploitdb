IglooFTP PRO for Windows platforms has been reported prone to multiple buffer overrun vulnerabilities.

The issue likely presents itself due do a lack of sufficient bounds checking performed on data that is copied into a reserved internal memory buffer. Remote arbitrary code execution has been confirmed.

It should be noted that although this vulnerability has been reported to affect IglooFTP PRO version 3.8, other versions might also be affected.
