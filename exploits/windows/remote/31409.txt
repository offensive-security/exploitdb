BootManage TFTP Server is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied data before storing it in a finite-sized buffer.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

BootManage TFTP Server 1.99 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
