A buffer overrun condition has been discovered in the SWRemote parameter used in Macromedia Flash objects. By triggering the overrun it is possible for an attacker to corrupt sensitive heap memory.

Exploiting this issue may allow a remote attacker to redirect program flow to malicious shellcode, resulting in the execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the browser process.

This vulnerability was discovered in Macromedia Flash ActiveX 6.0.47. It is not yet known if earlier versions are affected.
