Google Chrome is prone to an information-disclosure vulnerability because it fails to adequately validate server-issued instructions while in PASV (passive) mode.

Attackers can exploit this issue to port-scan networks inside a victim computer's firewall. Information harvested may aid in further attacks.

Google Chrome 1.0.154.36 is affected; other versions may also be vulnerable.
