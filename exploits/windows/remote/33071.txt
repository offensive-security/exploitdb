 INTRODUCTION
=====================================================================================================

- In short, this tool registers a rogue agent on the ePo server and then takes advantage of the
  following vulnerabilities to perform multiple actions :

	- CVE-2013-0140 : Pre-auth SQL Injection
	- CVE-2013-0141 : Pre-auth Directory Path Traversal

- The tool manages the following actions, called "mode" :

     -r, --register          Register a new agent on the ePo server (it's free)
     --check                 Check the SQL Injection vunerability
     --add-admin             Add a new web admin account into the DB
     --readdb                Retrieve various information from the database
     --get-install-path      Retrieve the installation path of ePo software (needed for other modes)
     --ad-creds              Retrieve and decrypt cached domain credentials from ePo database.
     --wipe                  Wipe our traces from the database and file system
     --srv-exec              Perform remote command execution on the ePo server
     --srv-upload            Upload files on the ePo server
     --cli-deploy            Deploy commands or softwares on clients


- It is strongly advised to read the manual which explains how to use these modes (see below).
  But basically, your two first actions must be :

	1) Register a rogue agent using '--register'

	2) Setup Remote Code execution using '--srv-exec --wizard'


- Usage examples are provided at the end of this file. It is recommended to read the doc before
  any of usage of them.

- You may find a vulnerable version of the ePo software on my blog. Deploy 2 VMs (eposrv + epocli) and
  test it !

- The tool was developed/tested on Backtrack 5r3, Kali Linux 1.0.6 and Ubuntu 12.04.
  It won't work under Windows due to linux tools dependencies.
  . ePolicy Orchestrator was running on Win2003 and Win2003 R2
  . The managed station were running on WinXPsp3 and Win7
