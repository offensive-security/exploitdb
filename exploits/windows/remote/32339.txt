Microsoft Organization Chart is prone to a remote code-execution vulnerability because of a memory-access violation.

Remote attackers can exploit this issue by enticing victims into opening a maliciously crafted Organization Chart document.

Successful exploits may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will likely result in a denial of service.

Microsoft Organization Chart 2.00,19 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
