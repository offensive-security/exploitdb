GEM Engine is prone to multiple vulnerabilities including multiple denial-of-service issues and a buffer-overflow issue.

An attacker can exploit these issues to cause applications using the engine to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition, or to execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable application. Other attacks may also be possible.

GEM Engine 2 and GEM Engine 3 are vulnerable.
