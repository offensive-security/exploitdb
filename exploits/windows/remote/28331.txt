| OVERVIEW |
+----------+

The release of this advisory provides exploitation details in relation to a
known patched vulnerability in Oracle Java.   These details were obtained
through the Packet Storm Bug Bounty program and are being released to the
community.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------+
| DETAILS |
+---------+

The ShortComponentRaster.verify() method in Oracle Java versions prior to 7u25
is vulnerable to a memory corruption vulnerability that allows bypassing of
"dataOffsets[]" boundary checks when the "numDataElements" field is 0.  This
vulnerability allows for remote code execution.  User interaction is required
for this exploit in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a
malicious file.
