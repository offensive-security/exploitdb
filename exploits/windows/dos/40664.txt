The DxgkDdiEscape handler for 0x70001b2 doesn't do proper bounds checks for its
variable size input.

void sub_8C4304(...) {
        ...
        // escape_->size is controlled by the user.
        if ( escape_->size < size )
          size = escape_->size;
        memcpy(escape_->data, v31, 28i64 * size);
        ...
}

Note that this appears to be a common pattern. Normally, before
escape handlers are executed, |PrivateDriverDataSize| (from DXGKARG_ESCAPE)
is checked to be equal to some value against a hardcoded table. However, some escapes
allow a more relaxed check that |PrivateDriverDataSize| >= minimum. This means that
the handler themselves must implement an ad hoc bounds check, which either seems to be
missing or implemented incorrectly (relying on a user specified value) in many cases.

bug 936 is a similar issue and there are likely more. I've noticed (but not confirmed)
a few more OOB reads that I haven't reported that follow this same pattern.

Crashing context with PoC (Win 10 x64 with 372.54):

To reproduce, compile as an x64 executable an run (requires WDK for D3DKMTEscape).
