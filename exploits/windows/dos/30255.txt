PC SOFT WinDEV is prone to a stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability when it attempts to process malformed project files. This issue occurs because the application fails to perform proper bounds-checking on user-supplied data before copying it to an insufficiently sized memory buffer.

An attacker may exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application or to cause denial-of-service conditions. This may facilitate unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

PC SOFT WinDEV 11 is reported vulnerable; other versions and related products (WinDEV Express, Mobile, and WebDEV) may also be affected.
