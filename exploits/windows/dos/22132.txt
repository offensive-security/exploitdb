Microsoft Windows is vulnerable to a denial of service condition when attempting to view certain OpenType fonts (.otf). When a malformed font file is viewed with the default Windows font viewer, it will cause the system to Blue Screen and reboot.

The exact cause of this issue is not currently known, however, this record will be updated if and when more details become available.
