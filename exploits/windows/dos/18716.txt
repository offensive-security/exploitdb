High


Details:
========
A Buffer Overflow vulnerability is detected on BulletProof FTP Client v2010.75.0.76 (current version).  The vulnerability is located
in the main executeable bpftpclient.exe. During the start of the application the value LogFileName from the
registry key [HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/BulletProof Software/BulletProof FTP Client 2010/Options] is read.
When inserting an oversized value to the registry value a buffer overflow is triggered. The victim only needs to start the application.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                                   [+]  bpftpclient.exe

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers. Successful exploitation requires no user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

    writeFile = open (file, "w")
    writeFile.write( poc )
    writeFile.close()
    print "[*] File successfully created!";
except:
    print "[!] Error while creating file!";



Risk:
=====
The security risk of the local buffer overflow vulnerability is estimated as high(+).
