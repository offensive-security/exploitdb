War Times is susceptible to a remote denial of service vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly bounds check user-supplied network data prior to copying it into a fixed-size memory buffer.

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to crash the game server, denying service to legitimate users.

Version 1.03, and prior are affected by this issue.
