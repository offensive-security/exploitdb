SurgeMail and WebMail are prone to a remote format-string vulnerability because the applications fail to properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the format-specifier argument of a formatted-printing function.

A remote attacker may execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial of service.

This issue affects the following:

SurgeMail 38k4, beta 39a and earlier
Netwin WebMail 3.1s and earlier
