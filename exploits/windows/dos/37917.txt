We have encountered a number of Windows kernel crashes in the ATMFD.DLL OpenType driver while processing corrupted OTF font files, such as:

---
DRIVER_PAGE_FAULT_IN_FREED_SPECIAL_POOL (d5)
Memory was referenced after it was freed.
This cannot be protected by try-except.
When possible, the guilty driver's name (Unicode string) is printed on
the bugcheck screen and saved in KiBugCheckDriver.
Arguments:
Arg1: fc937cdf, memory referenced
Arg2: 00000000, value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation
Arg3: 91d75195, if non-zero, the address which referenced memory.
Arg4: 00000000, (reserved)

The bugcheck is caused by an attempt to read memory from an unmapped address. The specific expression being dereferenced by ATMFD.DLL is "base address of the Name INDEX data + NAME.offset[x] - 1", however no bounds checking is performed over the value of NAME.offset[x] before using it for pointer arithmetic. To our current knowledge, this condition can only lead to an out-of-bounds read, thus limiting the impact of the bug to remote denial of service, or potentially local kernel memory disclosure. However, we have not fully confirmed that the severity of the bug is not in fact more significant due to some further ATMFD logic we are not aware of.

The issue reproduces on Windows 7 and 8.1. It is easiest to reproduce with Special Pools enabled for ATMFD.DLL (leading to an immediate crash when the bug is triggered), but it should also be possible to observe a crash on a default Windows installation in ATMFD.DLL.

Attached is an archive with three proof of concept font files together with corresponding kernel crash logs.
