The DxgkDdiEscape handler for escape 0x100009a lacks proper bounds checks:

case 0x100009A:
  ...
  size_0 = escape_data->size_1;
  ...
  size_1 = 2 - (escape_data->unknown < 18);
  ...
  size_2 = escape_data->size_2;
  ...
  total_size = size_0 * size_1 * size_2;
  ...

  if (total_size > 0x10)
    do_debug_thingo();

  if (total_size) {
    DWORD* ptr = alloced_buf + 24;
    DWORD* user_buf = escape_data->data;
    ...
    while (total_size) {
      *(ptr - 1) = *(user_buf - 1);
      *ptr = *user_buf;
      ...
      user_buf += 4;
      ptr += 39;
      --total_size;
    }

There is a check that total_size > 0x10, which calls some kind of a
debug/logging function (do_debug_thingo in my pseudocode), but it does not
actually stop processing of the escape. This leads to buffer overflow on the
allocated pool buffer later on.

Note that there is also a potential integer overflow in the calculation of
|total_size|. Since the individual sizes (size_0, size_1, size_2) appear to be
stored in a struct and eventually passed off to another function, there may be
more problems later on too.
