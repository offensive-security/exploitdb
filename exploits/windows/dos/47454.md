# CVE-2019-15943

Counter-Strike Global Offensive (vphysics.dll) before 1.37.1.1 allows remote attackers to achieve code execution or denial of service by creating a gaming server and inviting a victim to this server, because a crafted map using memory corruption.

### Description:

We are need modifying class name value in our PoC for triggering this vulnerability, offset for modifying in our PoC is `0x115703`. For example add char `"="` using this offset. PoC is "mc.bsp"

For modeling situation for attack we are need next:
First step is copy mc.bsp to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\maps`;

Second step is start game with our map (mc.bsp), for this we are need turn on game console and insert in console: `map mc`.

I was use msec.dll (!exploitable) is a Windows debugging extension (Windbg) that provides automated crash analysis and security risk assessment [Download msec.dll](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=msecdbg)
As you can see msec.dll checked this crash and decide that is EXPLOITABLE crash, because SEH chain is corrupted. It is means that attacker can use this vulnerability for remote code execution.
