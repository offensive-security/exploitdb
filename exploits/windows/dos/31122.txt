Ipswitch Instant Messaging is prone to multiple security vulnerabilities, including a denial-of-service vulnerability, a format-string vulnerability, and a vulnerability that allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary files.

Attackers can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code, cause denial-of-service conditions, or overwrite files with arbitrary content.

These issues affect Ipswitch Instant Messaging 2.0.8.1; other versions may also be affected.
