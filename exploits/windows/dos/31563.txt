SLMail Pro is prone to multiple remote denial-of-service vulnerabilities and memory-corruption vulnerabilities.

Attackers can exploit these issues to crash the application, resulting in denial-of-service conditions. Given the nature of some of these issues, attackers may also be able to execute arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

SLMail Pro 6.3.1.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
