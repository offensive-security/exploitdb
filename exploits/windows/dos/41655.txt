Through fuzzing, we have discovered a number of different crashes in the Windows Uniscribe user-mode library, while trying to display text using a corrupted font file or calling documented Uniscribe API functions against such malformed fonts. In this bug, we address a variety of crashes manifested through invalid memory READ accesses. Some of them occur at page boundaries, while other at seemingly valid yet non-mapped addresses. The sheer amount of the crashes makes it very difficult for us to assess the root cause, severity and impact of each of them within a reasonable time-frame. Consequently, we have only performed basic deduplication based on the top-level address of the faulting instruction, and are reporting all of such crashes in this single bug tracker entry.

A summary of the crash locations is as follows:

All of the issues reproduce successfully on Windows 7. It is highly encouraged to enable PageHeap for the test program in order to get reliable repros. It is also necessary to use a custom program which displays all of the font's glyphs at various point sizes, and additionally calls some of the Uniscribe-specific API functions.
