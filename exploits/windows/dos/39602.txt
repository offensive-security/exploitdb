The LZMA specification says the following about the memory usage of decompression:

"The size of the probability model counter arrays is calculated with the following formula: size_of_prob_arrays = 1846 + 768 * (1 << (lp + lc))"

But that formula only holds true if you keep the parameters within the specified range, which the SDK gives as:

lp - The number of literal pos bits (low bits of current position for literals).
     It can be in the range from 0 to 4. The default value is 0.

lc - The number of literal context bits (high bits of previous literal).
     It can be in the range from 0 to 8. The default value is 3.

If you set the parameters outside those ranges, then the rest of the assumptions don't hold and memory corruption can occur. Comodo do not attempt to keep these parameters in range, and lots of memory corruption can occur, the attached testcase should crash during an LZMA decode operation by overflowing a heap buffer.

This vulnerability is obviously exploitable for remote code execution as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

This is trying to initialize the probabilities array, but overflowing the heap buffer allocated and running off a page boundary.
