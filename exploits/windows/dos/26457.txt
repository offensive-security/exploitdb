Microsoft Internet Explorer is affected by a denial of service vulnerability. This issue arises because the application fails to properly parse certain malformed HTML content.

An attacker may exploit this issue by enticing a user to visit a malicious site resulting in a denial of service condition in the application.

Few details are available at this time; this BID will be updated as further information is disclosed.
