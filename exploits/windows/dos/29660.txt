Microsoft Office is prone to a denial-of-service condition when the malformed WMF file is viewed in an Office application.

Exploiting this issue allows remote attackers to crash applications, denying service to legitimate users.

Microsoft Office 2003 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.

Note: IrfanView version 3.99 is also vulnerable to this issue.
