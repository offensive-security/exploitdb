The TCP/IP Printing Service (also known as Print Services for Unix in Windows 2000) is the mechanism used for print service integration with Unix environments.

It relies on port 515 for data transmittal. A malformed print request sent to this particular port can cause the service to cease functioning and can affect other services as well, including SimpTCP, DHCPServer, FTPSvc, LPDSvc, and BinlSvc. The service will require to be stopped and restarted in order to regain normal functionality.

The TCP/IP Printing Service is not installed by default on Windows NT or Windows 2000 and this exploit does not affect the printing services native to Windows.
