We have encountered a Windows kernel crash in the win32k.sys driver while processing a corrupted TTF font file. An example of a crash log excerpt generated after triggering the bug is shown below:

---
BAD_POOL_HEADER (19)
The pool is already corrupt at the time of the current request.
This may or may not be due to the caller.
The internal pool links must be walked to figure out a possible cause of
the problem, and then special pool applied to the suspect tags or the driver
verifier to a suspect driver.
Arguments:
Arg1: 00000021, the data following the pool block being freed is corrupt.  Typically this means the consumer (call stack ) has overrun the block.
Arg2: ff66c000, The pool pointer being freed.
Arg3: 00001038, The number of bytes allocated for the pool block.
Arg4: 00000000, The corrupted value found following the pool block.

The type of the bugcheck implies a pool-based buffer overflow or some other type of pool corruption, potentially allowing for remote code execution in the context of the Windows kernel. While we have not determined the specific root cause of the vulnerability, we have pinpointed the offending mutations to reside in the "EBLC" and "EBSC" tables.

The issue reproduces on Windows 7. It is easiest to reproduce with Special Pools enabled for win32k.sys, but it is also possible to observe a crash on a default Windows installation in win32k.sys or another location in kernel space, as caused by the corrupted pool state.

Attached is an archive with the proof-of-concept mutated TTF file, together with the original font used to generate it and a corresponding crash log from Windows 7 32-bit.

The vendor communication timeline is as follows:

12/22/2015 Vulnerability is reported to Microsoft.
12/22/2015 MSRC acknowledges the receipt of the report.
01/09/2016 MSRC informs us they are unable to reproduce the issue and ask for a crash dump that may help.
01/11/2016 We send MSRC 32-bit and 64-bit crash dumps, together with additional repro information.
01/11/2016 MSRC acknowledges the receipt of the new information.
01/21/2016 MSRC informs us they still cannot reproduce the crash, and the provided crash dumps didn't help. They ask for more detailed information (full crash dump, environment details, POC program etc.)
01/25/2016 Upon further investigation, we realize that the bugcheck only occurs if the [Computer => Properties => Advanced system settings => Advanced => Performance => Settings => Visual Effects => Smooth edges of screen fonts] option is unchecked in system settings, and let MSRC know about this discovery.
01/25/2016 MSRC confirm that the crash now reproduces reliably on their side.

Since Microsoft was only able to get a repro of this issue on 01/25/2016 due to the non-standard system settings, we are resetting the 90-day period start date to that day.

When the "Smooth edges of screen fonts" option is disabled, the bugcheck also occurs on versions of Windows other than 7 (confirmed with Windows 8.1). By further minimizing the POC sample, it is also possible to trigger the crash by simply opening it in the default "Windows Font Viewer" utility.
