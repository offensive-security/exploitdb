Yahoo! Messenger is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to handle certain file-transfer packets.

Attackers can exploit this issue to crash the application, causing denial-of-service conditions.

NOTE: This issue is reportedly caused by a buffer-overflow issue, but this has not been confirmed.

Yahoo! Messenger 8.1.0.209 and 8.1.0.402 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
