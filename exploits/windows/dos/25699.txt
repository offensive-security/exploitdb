The Halo Game Server is prone to a denial-of-service condition. The issue arises when malformed data is sent to the game server, causing it to enter an infinite loop.

This issue was reported to affect Halo Game Server 1.06; earlier versions are likely vulnerable.

UPDATE: The vulnerability also affects Halo Game Server 1.07.
