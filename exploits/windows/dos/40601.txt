We have encountered a Windows kernel crash in the nt!RtlValidRelativeSecurityDescriptor function invoked by nt!CmpValidateHiveSecurityDescriptors while loading corrupted registry hive files. An example of a crash log excerpt generated after triggering the bug is shown below:

---
KERNEL_MODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M (1000008e)
This is a very common bugcheck.  Usually the exception address pinpoints
the driver/function that caused the problem.  Always note this address
as well as the link date of the driver/image that contains this address.
Some common problems are exception code 0x80000003.  This means a hard
coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but this system was booted
/NODEBUG.  This is not supposed to happen as developers should never have
hardcoded breakpoints in retail code, but ...
If this happens, make sure a debugger gets connected, and the
system is booted /DEBUG.  This will let us see why this breakpoint is
happening.
Arguments:
Arg1: c0000005, The exception code that was not handled
Arg2: 81815974, The address that the exception occurred at
Arg3: 80795644, Trap Frame
Arg4: 00000000

The bug seems to be caused by insufficient verification of the security descriptor length passed to the nt!RtlValidRelativeSecurityDescriptor function. An inadequately large length can render the verification of any further offsets useless, which is what happens in this particular instance. Even though the nt!RtlpValidateSDOffsetAndSize function is called to sanitize each offset in the descriptor used to access memory, it returns success due to operating on falsely large size. This condition can be leveraged to get the kernel to dereference any address relative to the pool allocation, which may lead to system crash or disclosure of kernel-mode memory. We have not investigated if the bug may allow out-of-bounds memory write access, but if that is the case, its severity would be further elevated.

The issue reproduces on Windows 7 and 8.1. In order to reproduce the problem with the provided sample, it is necessary to load it with a dedicated program which calls the RegLoadAppKey() API.

Attached is a proof of concept hive file.
