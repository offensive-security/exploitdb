- The test case reproduces on Windows 7 using IE11. It does not appear to immediately reproduce on Windows+Chrome or Linux+Chrome.

- The crash can also reproduce on one of the two mov instructions prior to the jmp shown here.

- The crash appears to occur due to a use-after-free related to loading a sub-resource from a URL.

- The test case minimizes to an 11-bit difference from the original sample file.

- The following test cases are attached: 2038518113_crash.swf (crashing file), 2038518113_min.swf (minimized file), 2038518113_orig.swf (original non-crashing file).
