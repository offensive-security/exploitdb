We have observed a number of Windows kernel crashes in the win32k.sys driver while processing corrupted TTF font files. An example of a crash log excerpt generated after triggering the bug is shown below:

While the above is only one example, we have seen the issue manifest itself in a variety of ways: either by crashing while trying to write beyond a pool allocation in the win32k!or_all_4_wide_rotated_need_last, win32k!or_all_N_wide_rotated_need_last, win32k!or_all_N_wide_rotated_no_last or win32k!or_all_N_wide_unrotated functions, or in other locations in the kernel due to system instability caused by pool corruption. In all cases, the crash occurs somewhere below a win32k!EngTextOut function call, i.e. it is triggered while trying to display the glyphs of a malformed TTF on the screen, rather than while loading the font in the system.

We believe the condition to be a pool-based buffer overflow triggered by one of the above win32k.sys functions, with a binary -or- operation being performed on bytes outside a pool allocation. This is also confirmed by the fact that various system bugchecks we have observed are a consequence of the kernel trying to dereference addresses with too many bits set, e.g.:

While we have not determined the specific root cause of the vulnerability, the proof-of-concept TTF files triggering the bug were created by taking legitimate fonts and replacing the glyph TrueType programs with ones generated by a dedicated generator. Therefore, the problem is almost certainly caused by some part of the arbitrary TrueType programs.

The issue reproduces on Windows 7 and 8.1. It is easiest to reproduce with Special Pools enabled for win32k.sys (typically leading to an immediate crash in one of the aforementioned functions when the overflow takes place), but it is also possible to observe a system crash on a default Windows installation as a consequence of pool corruption and resulting system instability. In order to reproduce the problem with the provided samples, it is necessary to use a custom program which displays all of the font's glyphs at various point sizes.

Attached is an archive with several proof-of-concept TTF files, together with corresponding kernel crash logs from Windows 7 64-bit.
