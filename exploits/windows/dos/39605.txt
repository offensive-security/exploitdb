A major component of Comodo Antivirus is the x86 emulator, which includes a number of shims for win32 API routines so that common API calls work in emulated programs (CreateFile, LoadLibrary, etc). The emulator itself is located in MACH32.DLL, which is compiled without /DYNAMICBASE, and runs as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

These API routines access memory from the emulated virtual machine, perform the requested operation, and then poke the result back into the emulator. Because these emulated routines are all native code, they must take care not to trust values extracted from the emulator, which is running attacker controlled code.

Browsing through the list of emulated routines, MSVBVM60!rtcLowerCaseVar jumped out as an obvious case of integer overflow due to trusting attacker-provided parameters.

The code attempts to extract a VT_BSTR VARIANT, which contains a pascal-like string, something like:

struct BSTR {
 DWORD Length;
 CHAR Data[0];
};

In pseudocode, the code does something like this:

vm->ReadMemory(Parameter1); // PVARIANT
vm->ReadMemory(Parameter2); // PVARIANT

vm->GetData(&LocalVariant, Parameter2); // Read the second VARIANT

if (LocalVariant.vt !== VT_BSTR)  // Verify it's a BSTR
 return false;

vm->GetData(&szLen, LocalVariant.bstr - 4); // Try to read the Length of the BSTR


The code attempts to convert this BSTR into a nul-terminated wide string. This requires 2 additional bytes (for the terminator), so providing a length of 0xFFFFFFFF will cause the allocation to wrap.

Buf = malloc(szLen + 2); // Allocate space for the string
vm->GetWideString(Buf, Ptr, szLen >> 1); // Read Length/2 WCHARs


This will read Length/2 WCHAR's from the hostile virtual machine and clobber the trusted heap buffer. The corruption can be halted early by placing the BSTR before an unmapped page boundary, resulting in a nice clean heap overflow.

The scan process which runs as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and does not use ASLR, making this a critical remote memory corruption that can be exploited via email, http, etc with zero user interaction.

I think the same bug exists in rtcSpaceBstr, rtcSpaceVar, rtcUpperCaseBstr, rtcUpperCaseVar, and maybe a few more.
