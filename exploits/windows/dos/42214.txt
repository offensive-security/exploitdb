We have discovered that the win32k!NtGdiEnumFonts system call handler discloses very large portions of uninitialized pool memory to user-mode clients.

The issue can be reproduced by running the attached proof-of-concept program on a system with the Special Pools mechanism enabled for win32k.sys. Then, it is clearly visible that a significant number of the bytes are equal to the markers inserted by Special Pools, and would otherwise contain leftover data that was previously stored in that memory region. In this case, the marker byte is 0x47 ("G"), and a dump of the initial 512 bytes of output is shown below. A full dump of the output can be found in the attached file.
