 Info (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobipocket):
 Mobipocket SA is a French company incorporated in March 2000 which
 produces Mobipocket Reader software, an E-Book reader for some PDAs,
 phones and desktop operating systems.

 The Mobipocket software package is free and consists of various
 publishing and reading tools for PDA, Smartphones, cellular phones
 and e-book devices (Symbian, Windows Mobile, Palm OS, webOS, Java ME,
 BlackBerry, Psion, Kindle and iLiad).
 Mobipocket.com was bought by Amazon.com in 2005.[1] Amazon's acquisition
 was believed to be a result of Adobe Systems's announcement that it would
 no longer sell its eBook packaging and serving software.[2]

 An alpha release of the java-based version of the mobipocket reader was
 made available for cellphones on June 30, 2008.[3] There is also a reader
 for desktop computers running Microsoft Windows, which also works with
 computers running Mac OS X and Linux using WINE.[4]

 It has been widely reported that since Amazon's acquisition of Mobipocket,
 software support, user support, and platform growth was ended. In December,
 2011, it was reported that Amazon officially notified the book publishers
 that it was ending support for Mobipocket.
 RIP: Mobipocket 2000-2011, Mobipocket eBook Format Is Gone, et.al. The
 status of Mobipocket DRM content previously purchased by users continues
 to be unclear since currently no other ebook reader supports this propriety
 DRM method.

 PoC released as is, I have no time at the moment for further investigations

 Crafting a .chm file is possible to cause a stack based buffer overflow. In
 the case of this PoC, registers at the moment of crash are as follow.

 As you can see, the content of EIP is just the value of the stack address
 at 0x0012F6E8
