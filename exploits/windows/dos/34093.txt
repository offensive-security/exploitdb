Battlefield 2 and Battlefield 2142 are prone to multiple remote denial-of-service vulnerabilities because the applications fail to properly handle specially crafted network packets.

An attacker can exploit these issues to cause the applications to become unresponsive or to crash the affected game servers, denying service to legitimate users.

Battlefield 2 1.41 and Battlefield 2142 1.50 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
