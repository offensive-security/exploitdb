We have encountered a number of Windows kernel crashes in the ATMFD.DLL OpenType driver while processing corrupted OTF font files, such as:

---
DRIVER_PAGE_FAULT_IN_FREED_SPECIAL_POOL (d5)
Memory was referenced after it was freed.
This cannot be protected by try-except.
When possible, the guilty driver's name (Unicode string) is printed on
the bugcheck screen and saved in KiBugCheckDriver.
Arguments:
Arg1: ff404e04, memory referenced
Arg2: 00000000, value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation
Arg3: 9194bf53, if non-zero, the address which referenced memory.
Arg4: 00000000, (reserved)

The bugcheck is caused by an attempt to read memory from an unmapped address. Specifically, the function is responsible for parsing the FDSelect region, and the crashing instruction is responsible for checking the version byte (can be either 0 or 3). The reason of the bugcheck is the fact that the kernel doesn't perform any bounds checking against the 32-bit FDSelect offset specified in the Top DICT, key "12 37", and instead uses it directly as an index into a user-mode input data buffer. While invalid user-mode memory accesses are gracefully handled by ATMFD, the controlled offset can be set on 32-bit platforms such that it points into kernel space, thus resulting in a reproducible system bugcheck.

To our current knowledge, this condition can only lead to an out-of-bounds read, thus limiting the impact of the bug to remote denial of service, or potentially local kernel memory disclosure. However, we have not fully confirmed that the severity of the bug is not in fact more significant due to some further ATMFD logic we are not aware of.

The issue reproduces on reliably Windows 7 and 8.1. It is easiest to reproduce and possibly exploit on 32-bit versions of Windows, as the "buffer + 32-bit controlled offset" expression evaluates to a kernel-mode address, while on 64-bit platforms it remains in the user space area and therefore the exception is gracefully handled by the ATMFD.DLL exception handler.

Attached is an archive with two proof of concept font files together with corresponding kernel crash logs.
