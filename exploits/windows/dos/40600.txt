We have encountered Windows kernel crashes in the memmove() function called by nt!CmpCheckValueList while loading corrupted registry hive files. An example of a crash log excerpt generated after triggering the bug is shown below:

---
ATTEMPTED_WRITE_TO_READONLY_MEMORY (be)
An attempt was made to write to readonly memory.  The guilty driver is on the
stack trace (and is typically the current instruction pointer).
When possible, the guilty driver's name (Unicode string) is printed on
the bugcheck screen and saved in KiBugCheckDriver.
Arguments:
Arg1: b008d000, Virtual address for the attempted write.
Arg2: 45752121, PTE contents.
Arg3: a5d9b590, (reserved)
Arg4: 0000000b, (reserved)

The root cause of the bug seems to be that the nt!CmpCheckValueList function miscalculates the number of items to be shifted to the left in an array with 4-byte entries, resulting in the following call:

RtlMoveMemory(&array[x], &array[x + 1], 4 * (--y - x));

Here, the eventual value of the size parameter becomes negative (--y is smaller than x), but is treated by RtlMoveMemory as an unsigned integer, which is way beyond the size of the memory region, resulting in memory corruption. In a majority of observed cases, the specific negative value ended up being 0xfffffffc (-4), but we have also seen a few samples which crashed with size=0xfffffff8 (-8).

The issue reproduces on Windows 7. Considering the huge memory copy size, the crash should manifest both with and without Special Pools enabled. In order to reproduce the problem with the provided samples, it is necessary to load them with a dedicated program which calls the RegLoadAppKey() API.

Attached are three proof of concept hive files.
