MailEnable is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities in the IMAP service, including:

- Multiple buffer-overflow vulnerabilities.
- Multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities due to a NULL-pointer exception.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary code in the context of the running application or to crash the application, causing a denial of service.

These issues affect MailEnable 3.13; other versions may also be vulnerable.
