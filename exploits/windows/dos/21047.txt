It has been reported that it is possible to cause a denial of service on a Windows NT system using the 'NT4ALL' tool.

The DoS reportedly occurs after the system reboots while being set in 'special mode' using 'NT4ALL'.

In order to exploit NT4ALL, a local user must reportedly have write permissions to the C:\winnt\system32\ directory.

This is a non-default configuration.
