Microsoft Internet Explorer is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability in the JPEG image rendering library used by the browser. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly bounds check input data prior to copying it to a fixed size memory buffer.

This issue was identified by creating random input for the browser, and has not been researched further at this time. This BID will be updated as further information is disclosed.

Successful exploitation may result in execution of arbitrary code in the context of the user executing the affected browser.
