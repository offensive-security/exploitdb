We have encountered a number of Windows kernel crashes in the ATMFD.DLL OpenType driver while processing corrupted OTF font files, such as:

---
PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (50)
Invalid system memory was referenced.  This cannot be protected by try-except,
it must be protected by a Probe.  Typically the address is just plain bad or it
is pointing at freed memory.
Arguments:
Arg1: fff82008, memory referenced.
Arg2: 00000000, value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation.
Arg3: 91a3440b, If non-zero, the instruction address which referenced the bad memory
	address.
Arg4: 00000000, (reserved)

The crash represents a read from invalid memory; prior to being dereferenced as an address, the ESI register is loaded with a value from EAX+0x30 (on 32-bit Windows), which points into an "Adbe" pool allocation:

---
0: kd> !pool 9d619018
Pool page 9d619018 region is Paged session pool
9d619000 is not a valid large pool allocation, checking large session pool...
*9d619000 : large page allocation, Tag is Adbe, size is 0x4018 bytes
		Pooltag Adbe : Adobe's font driver
---

The surrounding code is a loop over a linked list of structures; the ESI register at the time of the crash holds a [F/B]link address which points to unmapped memory, potentially suggesting that the root cause of the crash is a use-after-free condition, or some kind of corruption of the linked list. Since the invalid address is later used to manipulate memory, we expect that this issue could be used to achieve remote code execution in the security context of the Windows kernel.

Moreover, we have also encountered similar crashes one instruction further in the code - in these cases, ESI turned out to accidentally point to mapped memory, but its contents did not correspond to the ATMFD's expectations (reinforcing the use-after-free hypothesis), thus resulting in an attempt to dereference a completely wild memory address, e.g.:

---
PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (50)
Invalid system memory was referenced.  This cannot be protected by try-except,
it must be protected by a Probe.  Typically the address is just plain bad or it
is pointing at freed memory.
Arguments:
Arg1: eebd8451, memory referenced.
Arg2: 00000000, value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation.
Arg3: 9205440e, If non-zero, the instruction address which referenced the bad memory
	address.
Arg4: 00000002, (reserved)

The issue reproduces on Windows 7 and 8.1. It is easiest to reproduce with Special Pools enabled for ATMFD.DLL (leading to an immediate crash when the bug is triggered), but it should also be possible to observe a crash on a default Windows installation in ATMFD.DLL.

Note that this crash is very similar in its nature to  Issue 383  (invalid memory access while traversing a linked list of "Adbe" structures); however, due to uncertainty about the reason of the crash and the different stack traces, I am filing this as a separate report for now.

Attached is an archive with six proof of concept font files (three for each crash location) together with corresponding kernel crash logs.
