Microsoft Windows is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability.

This issue occurs when a program calls certain API calls for manipulating Windows registry keys. This may crash the affected computer.

NOTE: This BID has been revised (July 3, 2007); the issue was originally thought to be a vulnerability in Symantec Norton Personal Firewall, but further investigation reveals a problem in an underlying OS API.
