We have encountered a crash in the Windows Uniscribe user-mode library, in the USP10!FillAlternatesList function, while trying to request a list of alternate glyphs for a specific glyph in a corrupted font file:

In our test harness, we set the cMaxAlternates parameter of the ScriptGetFontAlternateGlyphs function to 10, indicating that this is the maximum number of values which can be written to the output pAlternateGlyphs array. However, the API function does not seem to respect the argument and attempts to write more data into the buffer -- in this case, 29 WORDs. The vulnerability can also be confirmed by looking at the output value of pcAlternates, which should never exceed 10 in this case, but is indeed set to 29. As a result, the bug may lead to corruption of various memory areas, including stack, heap, and static memory, depending on the type of pointer passed to the function by its caller.

The issue reproduces on Windows 7. It is easiest to reproduce with PageHeap enabled and the output buffer allocated from the heap. In order to reproduce the problem with the provided samples, it is necessary to use a custom program which calls the vulnerable API function.

Attached is a proof of concept malformed font file which triggers the crash.
