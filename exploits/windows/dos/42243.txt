We have encountered a Windows kernel crash in the ATMFD.DLL OpenType driver while processing a corrupted OTF font file, see below:

---
DRIVER_PAGE_FAULT_BEYOND_END_OF_ALLOCATION (d6)
N bytes of memory was allocated and more than N bytes are being referenced.
This cannot be protected by try-except.
When possible, the guilty driver's name (Unicode string) is printed on
the bugcheck screen and saved in KiBugCheckDriver.
Arguments:
Arg1: fb69b01e, memory referenced
Arg2: 00000000, value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation
Arg3: 8f635862, if non-zero, the address which referenced memory.
Arg4: 00000000, (reserved)

The bugcheck is caused by an attempt to read memory from an unmapped address. The specific expression being dereferenced by ATMFD.DLL is "base address of the Name INDEX data + NAME.offset[x] - 1", however no bounds checking is performed over the value of NAME.offset[x] before using it for pointer arithmetic. To our current knowledge, this condition can only lead to an out-of-bounds read, thus limiting the impact of the bug to remote denial of service, or potentially local kernel memory disclosure. However, we have not fully confirmed that the severity of the bug is not in fact more significant due to some further ATMFD logic we are not aware of.

Interestingly, the crash is almost identical to the one reported in  Issue #386  (MSRC-30296) nearly two years ago, which was supposedly fixed as CVE-2015-2461 in the MS15-080 bulletin. The fact that the same bugcheck still reproduces can potentially mean that the patch was insufficient.

Only a single bitflip applied to a valid font file is sufficient to create an offending testcase (excluding SFNT table checksums). In our case, the byte at offset 0x375 in the original sample must be changed from 0x01 to 0x41. This corresponds to offset 0x71 of the "CFF " table. The PoC font can be found attached to this tracker entry.

The issue reproduces on Windows 7 (other platforms untested). It is easiest to reproduce with Special Pools enabled for ATMFD.DLL, leading to an immediate crash when the bug is triggered. The bugcheck occurs upon opening the font in any default utility such as the Windows Font Viewer -- no special tools are required.
