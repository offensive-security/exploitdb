We have encountered a number of Windows kernel crashes in the win32k.sys driver while processing corrupted TTF font files. The most frequent one occurring for the bug reported here is as follows:

---
  PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (50)
  Invalid system memory was referenced.  This cannot be protected by try-except,
  it must be protected by a Probe.  Typically the address is just plain bad or it
  is pointing at freed memory.
  Arguments:
  Arg1: 8273777f, memory referenced.
  Arg2: 00000000, value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation.
  Arg3: 919c279f, If non-zero, the instruction address which referenced the bad memory
    address.
  Arg4: 00000000, (reserved)

We have observed the invalid memory addresses accessed by the win32k!bGeneratePath function to be seemingly "wild", e.g. 0x8273777f, 0xe9849de5, 0xc7617bc7, 0xf2edc7eb etc. The above crash dump comes from an old version of Windows 7 32-bit, because symbols for win32k.sys on the latest build are currently unavailable on the Microsoft Symbol Server. Nevertheless, a crash summary from an up-to-date system is as follows:

While the above crashes are the most common ones, we have also encountered bugchecks (likely caused by the same issue) at the following other locations on old Windows 7 32-bit:

---
  win32k!vQsplineToPolyBezier+43
  91522614 8b4608          mov     eax,dword ptr [esi+8]
---
  win32k!vQsplineToPolyBezier+83
  92292654 8941fc          mov     dword ptr [ecx-4],eax
---

... and on latest Windows 7 32-bit:

---
  win32k!EngDeleteRgn+3293
  91e0747c 8b460c          mov     eax,dword ptr [esi+0Ch]
---

The crash in win32k!vQsplineToPolyBezier+83 strongly suggests that the failures are caused or may lead to memory corruption, and consequently to arbitrary code execution.

While we have not determined the specific root cause of the vulnerability, we have pinpointed the offending mutations to reside in the "fpgm" table. In case of the few samples we have examined, the problem seems to stem from changing one of the instructions in the FPGM program to "FLIPPT".

The issue reproduces on Windows 7 (other platforms unchecked). It is easiest to reproduce with Special Pools enabled for win32k.sys (leading to an immediate crash when the bug is triggered), but it it also possible to observe a system crash on a default Windows installation. In order to reproduce the problem with the provided samples, it is necessary to use a custom program which calls the GetGlyphOutline() API with various parameters over all of the font's glyphs.

Attached is an archive with several proof-of-concept mutated TTF files.
