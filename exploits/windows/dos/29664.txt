Microsoft Office Publisher is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because the application fails to properly handle malformed files.

Successfully exploiting this issue allows remote attackers to crash the affected application, denying service to legitimate users.

Microsoft Office Publisher 2007 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
