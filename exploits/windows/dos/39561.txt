We have encountered a Windows kernel crash in the ATMFD.DLL OpenType driver while processing a corrupted OTF font file:

---
DRIVER_OVERRAN_STACK_BUFFER (f7)
A driver has overrun a stack-based buffer.  This overrun could potentially
allow a malicious user to gain control of this machine.
DESCRIPTION
A driver overran a stack-based buffer (or local variable) in a way that would
have overwritten the function's return address and jumped back to an arbitrary
address when the function returned.  This is the classic "buffer overrun"
hacking attack and the system has been brought down to prevent a malicious user
from gaining complete control of it.
Do a kb to get a stack backtrace -- the last routine on the stack before the
buffer overrun handlers and bugcheck call is the one that overran its local
variable(s).
Arguments:
Arg1: a6703535, Actual security check cookie from the stack
Arg2: 98ee9e09, Expected security check cookie
Arg3: 671161f6, Complement of the expected security check cookie
Arg4: 00000000, zero

While we have not determined the specific root cause of the vulnerability, we have pinpointed the offending mutations to reside in the "CFF " table.

The immediate reason of the bugcheck is a stack corruption detected by the stack cookie protection (/GS). The issue reproduces on Windows 7 and 8.1; other platforms were not tested. In our environment, it is sufficient to open the offending font in the default Windows Font Viewer to reproduce the crash, or even click on a folder icon containing the font in Windows Explorer.

Attached is an archive with the proof-of-concept mutated OTF file, together with the original font used to generate it and a corresponding crash log from Windows 7 32-bit.
