We have encountered Windows kernel crashes in the internal nt!nt!HvpGetBinMemAlloc and nt!ExpFindAndRemoveTagBigPages functions while loading corrupted registry hive files. We believe both crashes to be caused by the same bug. Examples of crash log excerpts generated after triggering the bug are shown below:

---
PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (50)
Invalid system memory was referenced.  This cannot be protected by try-except.
Typically the address is just plain bad or it is pointing at freed memory.
Arguments:
Arg1: a2b23004, memory referenced.
Arg2: 00000000, value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation.
Arg3: 817f7f04, If non-zero, the instruction address which referenced the bad memory
	address.
Arg4: 00000000, (reserved)

BAD_POOL_HEADER (19)
The pool is already corrupt at the time of the current request.
This may or may not be due to the caller.
The internal pool links must be walked to figure out a possible cause of
the problem, and then special pool applied to the suspect tags or the driver
verifier to a suspect driver.

The issue reproduces on Windows 7 32- and 64-bit, and manifests itself both with and without Special Pools (but it is still advised to have the mechanism enabled). In order to reproduce the problem with the provided samples, it is necessary to load them with a dedicated program which calls the RegLoadAppKey() API.

The root cause of the crashes is unknown. It must be noted that in our test environment, reproduction has been very unreliable: the same hive could crash the system in one run, and then parse fine (or fail with an error) in 10 subsequent runs. In order to facilitate reproduction, I'm providing a high number of testcases which were seen to cause a bugcheck once or more, in hope that at least one of them will also reproduce externally.

################################################################################

On November 29, MSRC let us know that they were unable to reproduce a crash with the provided samples and report, and asked for more information and/or kernel crash dumps.

One day later, we've looked into the bug again and discovered that it wasn't sufficient to just load a single corrupted hive to trigger the bugcheck: instead, it is necessary to sequentially load several corrupted hives from the same path in the filesystem. MSRC confirmed that they could reliably reproduce the problem with this new information.

Since the additional detail is crucial to observe the symptoms of the bug and it was not included in the original report, I'm resetting the "Reported" date to November 30.
