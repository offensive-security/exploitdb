1) Introduction
===============



Adobe Photoshop is a graphics editing program developed and published by Adobe Systems Incorporated.

Adobe's 2003 "Creative Suite" rebranding led to Adobe Photoshop 8's renaming to Adobe Photoshop CS.

Thus, Adobe Photoshop CS5 is the 12th major release of Adobe Photoshop. The CS rebranding also resulted

in Adobe offering numerous software packages containing multiple Adobe programs for a reduced price.

Adobe Photoshop is released in two editions: Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Photoshop Extended, with the

Extended having extra 3D image creation, motion graphics editing, and advanced image analysis features.[6]

Adobe Photoshop Extended is included in all of Adobe's Creative Suite offerings except Design Standard,

which includes the Adobe Photoshop edition. Alongside Photoshop and Photoshop Extended, Adobe also

publishes Photoshop Elements and Photoshop Lightroom, collectively called "The Adobe Photoshop Family".

In 2008, Adobe released Adobe Photoshop Express, a free web-based image editing tool to edit photos directly

on blogs and social networking sites; in 2011 a version was released for the Android operating system and the

iOS operating system.[7][8] Adobe only supports Windows and Macintosh versions of Photoshop, but using Wine,

Photoshop CS5 can run well on Linux
