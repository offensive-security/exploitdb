A potential denial of service vulnerability exists in some versions of the Microsoft Windows network stack.

The problem occurs when a large number of extraneous ARP packets sent to a host running Windows. This can cause the system to use all available CPU and memory resources and thus become unresponsive until the attack ends.

By sending ARP requests to the Ethernet broadcast address, it may be possible to use this attack to disable an entire network.
