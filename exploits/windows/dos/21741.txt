SUMMARY

XnView Formats PlugIn is prone to an overflow condition. The JLS Plugin (xjpegls.dll) library fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow. With a specially crafted JLS compressed image file, a context-dependent attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code.
