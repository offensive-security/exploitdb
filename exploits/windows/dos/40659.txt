The DxgkDdiEscape handler for 0x600000D passes an unchecked user provided
pointer as the destination for a memcpy call. This leads to kernel memory
corruption.

(Win 10 x64 372.54) crashing context with PoC:

Resetting default scope

To reproduce, compile the PoC as a x64 binary (requires WDK for D3DKMTEscape),
and run.

For completeness, it looks like many of the other escape handlers in the same function has similar issues with writing to user provided pointers in an unchecked way. This should have been fairly obvious as the code is very close to each other in the same function.
