In order to test the POC code for the reported Issue 22, manually add
Vuln22Setup.class and Vuln22Setup$1.class to the original QTJava.zip
file from your CLASSPATH environment variable. This file is usually
located in lib\ext directory of your JRE base dir:

Microsoft Windows [Wersja 6.1.7601]
Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation. Wszelkie prawa zastrzezone.

c:\>set
ALLUSERSPROFILE=C:\ProgramData
APPDATA=C:\Users\Internet\AppData\Roaming
CLASSPATH=.;C:\_SOFTWARE\jre6\lib\ext\QTJava.zip
COMMANDER_DRIVE=C:
...

Both Vuln22Setup and Vuln22Setup$1 classes mimic undisclosed and not
yet patched, Oracle's Issue 15.

Successfull exploit run should lead to the execution of notepad.exe and
c:\se.txt file creation. Additionally, Java console output similar to the
one denoted below should be observed:

Java Plug-in 1.6.0_33
Using JRE version 1.6.0_33-b03 Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM
