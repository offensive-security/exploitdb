CRYPTOCard CRYPTOAdmin is a network authentication application for use with the Palm OS platform. CRYPTOAdmin generates a .pdb file which contains the username, PIN number, serial number, and key in encrypted or plaintext format. The PIN number can be retrieved due to the software's usage of a fixed 4-byte value in key generation. With access to the .pdb file and PIN number, a user is capable of duplicating the token onto another Palm device effectively gaining access to the network as the compromised user.
