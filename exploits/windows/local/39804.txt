Product:
---------------------
QuickBooks Desktop
versions: 2007 - 2016

Vulnerability Type:
---------------------
Arbitrary SQL / Code Execution

Vulnerability Details:
---------------------
QuickBooks company files are SQL Anywhere database files and other QB formats are based on SQL Anywhere features as well. SQL code (Watcom SQL) is important part of QB workflow and it is arguably more powerful than VBA in MS Access or Excel and at the same time it is completely hidden and starts automatically with every opened file!
Functions like xp_write_file, xp_cmdshell are included by default allowing "rootkit" installation in just 3 lines of code: get data from table -> xp_write_file -> xp_cmdshell. Procedure in one database can be used to insert code into another directly or using current user credential. Moreover real database content is hidden from QuickBooks users, so there is virtually unlimited storage for code, stolen data, etc.
QBX (accountant's transfer copies) and QBM (portable company files) are even easier to modify but supposed to be send to outside accountant for processing during normal workflow. QBX and QBM are compressed SQL dumps, so SQL modification is as hard as replacing zlib compressed "reload.sql" file inside compound file.
In all cases QuickBooks do not attempt (and have no ways) to verify SQL scripts and start them automatically with "DBA" privileges.
It should be obvious that all outside files (qbw, qba, qbx, qbm) should be considered extremely dangerous.
SQL Anywhere is built for embedded applications so there are number of tricks and functions (like SET HIDDEN clause) to protect SQL code from analysis making this severe QuickBooks design flaw.

Proof of Concept:
---------------------
Below you can find company file created in QB 2009 and modified to start "Notepad.exe" upon every user login (Admin, no pass). This example will work in any version including 2016 (US, CA, UK) - login procedure execution is required in order to check QB version or edition or to start update, so you will see Notepad before QB "wrong version" error message.
