[+] ISR: ApparitionSec



Vendor:
=======
www.symantec.com



Product:
===========
Symantec Endpoint Protection
v12.1.6 (12.1 RU6 MP5)
Symantec 12.1.7004.6500



Vulnerability Type:
===================
Tamper-Protection Bypass
Denial Of Service / Message Spoof



CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2017-6331
SSG16-041



Security Issue:
================
Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP), does not validate where WinAPI messages comes from (lack of UIPI).
Therefore, malware can easily spoof messages to the UI or send WM_SYSCOMMAND to close
the SEP UI denying end user ability to scan / run the EP AntiVirus protection. Spoofed messages could
also potentially inform a user a scan was clean.

Unfortunately Symantecs advisory left out details of the Denial Of Service as well as minimizing the
amount of text a malware could inject into the UI which would result in compromising the integrity of the
Symantec Endpoint Protection Control Panel user interface.
