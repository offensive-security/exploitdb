of Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader. User interaction is required in that a user must visit a
malicious web site or open a malicious file.The specific flaw exists when processing malicious
JavaScript contained in a PDF document. When supplying a specially crafted argument to the getIcon()
method of a Collab object, proper bounds checking is not performed resulting in a stack overflow.
