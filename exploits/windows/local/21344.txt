A vulnerability in Microsoft Windows 2000 and NT 4 could allow a user to gain SYSTEM-level privileges on the local host.

The debugging subsystem, which is available to all users, may be used to create duplicate handles to a privileged process. This may allow an application with minimal privileges to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process that is accessed.
