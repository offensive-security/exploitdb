Exploit-CVE-2017-6008

The CVE-2017-6008 is a vulnerability in the HitmanPro scan that allows privilege escalation by exploiting a kernel pool buffer overflow. The exploits here use the Quota Process Pointer Overwrite attack as described in the Tarjei Mandt's paper

Also, the exploits use my Pool sprayer library

Windows 10 version

This version use another vulnerability in the hitmanpro37.sys driver, an Out-Of-Bounds read, which we use to leak the Pool Cookie. This leak allows us to use the very same attack on Windows 10.

You can find a detailed paper of the exploit on Windows 10 here (coming soon):
