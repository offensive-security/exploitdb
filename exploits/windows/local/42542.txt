Summary: WebCTRL®, Automated Logic's web-based building automation
system, is known for its intuitive user interface and powerful integration
capabilities. It allows building operators to optimize and manage
all of their building systems - including HVAC, lighting, fire, elevators,
and security - all within a single HVAC controls platform. It's everything
they need to keep occupants comfortable, manage energy conservation measures,
identify key operational problems, and validate the results.

Desc: WebCTRL server/service suffers from an elevation of privileges vulnerability
which can be used by a simple authenticated user that can change the executable
file with a binary of choice. The vulnerability exist due to the improper permissions,
with the 'M' flag (Modify) or 'C' flag (Change) for 'Authenticated Users' group.
The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue as well impacting the service
'WebCTRL Service' for Windows deployed as part of WebCTRL server solution. This could
potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary
code with elevated privileges on the system. A successful attempt would require the
local user to be able to insert their code in the system root path undetected by the
OS or other security applications where it could potentially be executed during
application startup or reboot. If successful, the local user’s code would execute
with the elevated privileges of the application.

Tested on: Microsoft Windows 7 Professional SP1 (EN)
