# raptor_truecrypt - setuid truecrypt privilege escalation
# Copyright (c) 2007 Marco Ivaldi <raptor@0xdeadbeef.info>
#
# TrueCrypt 4.3, when installed setuid root, allows local users to cause a
# denial of service (filesystem unavailability) or gain privileges by mounting
# a crafted TrueCrypt volume, as demonstrated using (1) /usr/bin or (2) another
# user's home directory, a different issue than CVE-2007-1589 (CVE-2007-1738).
#
# WARNING: THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT EXPLOIT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NPTL THREAD
# LOCAL STORAGE DYNAMIC LINKING MODEL, DO NOT USE IT IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT
# WORKS! YEAH, IT *DOES* REQUIRE SOME TWEAKINGS TO EXPLOIT NON-TLS PLATFORMS!
#
# Other possible attack vectors: /etc/cron.{d,hourly,daily,weekly,monthly}, at
# (/var/spool/atjobs/), xinetd (/etc/xinetd.d), /etc/logrotate.d, and more...
