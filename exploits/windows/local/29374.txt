Kerio Personal Firewall is prone to a local privilege-escalation vulnerability.

A local attacker could exploit this issue to execute arbitrary machine code with SYSTEM-level privileges. A successful exploit could result in the complete compromise of the affected computer.

Versions 4.3.246 and 4.3.268 are vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
