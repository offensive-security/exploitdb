Missing bounds-checking in AVI stream parsing

When parsing AVI files, CAVIFileParser uses the stream count from the AVI header
to allocate backing storage for storing metadata about the streams (member
variable m_aStream). However, the number of stream headers we parse is never
validated against this allocation size during parsing, so we can write further
metadata past the end of this buffer by constructing a file which contains more
stream headers than expected.

The allocation happens here:

int CAVIFileParser::ParseChunkAviHdr(int a2, unsigned int chunk_size)
{
  struct AviHeader *avih;
  int result;

  // snip some sanity checking (have we already found an 'avih' chunk, is this
  // chunk large enough to contain an avi header.)

  result = AVISourceReader::AVI_fread(this->source, avih, sizeof(struct AviHeader), 1);
  if ( result <= 0 )
  {
    // snip...
  }
  else
  {
    stream_count = avih->dwStreams; // <-- this is an attacker-controlled count
    this->m_aStreamCount = stream_count;
    this->m_aStream = malloc(stream_count * sizeof(struct AviStream));
    this->m_aStreamIndex = -1;

    // snip...
  }

  return 1;
}

There doesn't appear to be any integer overflow checking in the multiplication
either; so if the current issue is directly fixed there could still be a
vulnerability if stream_count * sizeof(struct AviStream) overflows.

this->m_aStreamIndex is incremented without checking in
CAVIFileParser::ParseChild and used as an index into m_aStream in several places
without checking, including in CAVIFileParser::ParseChunkStrHdr and
CAVIFileParser::ParseChunkStrFmt.

Several of the values that we can get written out of bounds are pointers to
controlled data, which is an interesting exploitation primitive. I've attached
a PoC file and script to generate it which results in overlapping a SRIFFNode*
with the contents of a 'strf' chunk, resulting in a free of an attacker
controlled pointer - in this case, 0x41414141. Since the structure sizes are
dependent on the version of the library, this may not work on different builds,
but it will hopefully cause a crash regardless.
