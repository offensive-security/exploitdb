CVE-2019-2107 - looks scary. Still remember Stagefright and PNG bugs vulns ....
With CVE-2019-2107 the decoder/codec runs under mediacodec user and with properly "crafted" video (with tiles enabled - ps_pps->i1_tiles_enabled_flag) you can possibly do RCE. The codec affected is HVEC (a.k.a H.265 and MPEG-H Part 2)
