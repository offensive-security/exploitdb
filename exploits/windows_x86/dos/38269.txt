The PoC bug checks reliably with Special Pool enabled on writing to freed memory. A reference to the freed memory is held at offset +0x10 of the THREADINFO object. This memory is referenced in HmgAllocateObjectAttr which is called in multiple locations. The freed memory is a struct inside a Brush Object which is freed in the call NtGdiDeleteObjectApp.
