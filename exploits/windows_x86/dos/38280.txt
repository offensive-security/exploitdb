Tested on Win 7 32-bit with Special Pool enabled.

Multiple pool buffer overflows can be triggered through the NtGdiStretchBlt system call. The attached PoC demonstrates a write overflow and another read over flow issue which is likely to be usable for memory leaks (enabled by uncommenting the first NtGdiStretchBlt call).
