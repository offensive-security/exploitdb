This issue is very likely a null pointer issue affecting 32-bit Windows version. The offset is from add onto another offset which isn't quite zero, so not 100% convinced it is just a null pointer, however I wasn't able to influence the values. because it was very straight forward to get EIP there is a PoC setting EIP to 0xdeadbeef
Debug output attached.
