OpenPAM is prone to a local privilege-escalation vulnerability.

Local attackers may exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with superuser privileges. Successfully exploiting this issue will result in the complete compromise of affected computers.

#!/usr/bin/perl

# kcheckpass invoking pam_start() with user provided
# service argument, what a bad idea. OpenPAM accepts that.
# Maybe this pam_start() vulnerability is exploitable via
# other vectors as well.
# Vuln tested on a FreeBSD 8.1. It does not affect
# Linux PAM, as it is checking for / character

# (C) 2011 by some dude, meant as a PoC! Only use on your own
# machine and on your own risk!!!
