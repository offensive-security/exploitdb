This issue was uncovered with AFL (http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/)

There is a bug in dissect_nds_request located in epan/dissectors/packet-ncp2222.inc.

dissect_nds_request attempts to call ptvcursor_free() near packet-ncp2222.inc:11806 using the variable ptvc that is set to null at the start of dissect_nds_request. Using the attached sample, the only place ptvc could be set (~ncp2222.inc:11618) is never executed and thus ptvc remains a null pointer.
