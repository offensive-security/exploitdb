The attached tiff image causes a crash in ImageIO on the latest macOS and iOS. To reproduce the issue, the attached code (tester.m) can be used. I've attached another code snippet to reproduce the issue on iOS as well. With tester.m compiled with ASAN, processing the attached tiff image should crash with an access violation similar to the following:

    SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: SEGV (ImageIO:x86_64h+0xab38f) in invocation function for block in TIFFReadPlugin::DecodeBlocks(IIOImageRead*, GlobalTIFFInfo*, ReadPluginData const&, TIFFPluginData const&, std::__1::vector<IIODecodeFrameParams
    , std::__1::allocator<IIODecodeFrameParams> >&)
    ==70578==ABORTING

The overflow happens out of an mmap region as the memory buffer is allocated using ImageIO_Malloc, which is itself mostly a thin wrapper around mmap.

The crashing image was found through fuzzing and both the crashing as well as the original image are attached. The relevant byte change removes the BitsPerSample entry (original value is 8) from the TIFF file, in which case a default value of 1 will be used. As the SamplesPerPixel entry is still 3, the image will contain 3 bits per pixel, one for the red, one for the green, and one for the blue component. ImageIO will then allocate width*height*3 bytes of memory (for a RBG bitmap) using ImageIO_Malloc, then call TIFFReadPlugin::DecodeBlocks to write the image data into the buffer. Next, ImageIO uses the tile-oriented TIFF api [1] to read out a tile of the image in its current encoding (3 bits per pixel). The default tile size seems to be 0x100 x 0x100 and so the entire image (which is 143 x 190 pixels large) fits into one tile. Since there are three bits per pixel, the tile has a total of 0x100*0x100*3/8 = 0x6000 bytes, which is what TIFFReadTile returns. Finally, it appears that ImageIO then uses the returned size (0x6000) to decode the image instead of the correct image size (143 x 190). As such, it writes 0x6000*8 bytes (since the output format uses 8 bits per component, not 1) to the output buffer, or about 2.4 times the allocated size. The program then crashes with a memory violation.

Since the buffer is already allocated using mmap, adding a guard page after it would likely prevent this and similar bugs from being exploitable in the future.

The attached archive contains the original image and the mutated one causing the crash. It also contains code to reproduce the issue on macOS and iOS. Finally, it contains a python script to change the byte in question in the original file to remove the BitsPerSample entry and thus trigger the issue.
