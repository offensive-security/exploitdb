A vulnerability has been reported in the Roger Wilco Server, it is reported that a user does not need to connect to the server over the TCP port to have UDP based audio streams handled. Rather the attacker will require knowledge of user ID's connected to a target channel. Because the user ID's for a channel exist in a range of 0-127, the attacker may transmit an audio stream to an affected server that will be heard by all connected users, however the server administrator will have no control over disconnecting or muting this audio stream.
