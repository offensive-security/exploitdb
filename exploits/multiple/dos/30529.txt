Media Player Classic is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied data.

Attackers may attempt to exploit this issue by coercing users to access malicious FLI files.

Successfully exploiting this issue allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary machine code in the context of the user running the affected application. This facilitates the remote compromise of affected computers.

Media Player Classic 6.4.9.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
