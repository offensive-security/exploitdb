If an mp3 file contains compressed ID3 data that is larger than 0x2aaaaaaa bytes, an integer overflow will occur in allocating the buffer to contain its converted string data, leading to a large copy into a small buffer. A sample fla, swf and mp3 are attached. Put id34.swf and tag.mp3 in the same folder to reproduce the issue. This issue only works on 64 bit platforms.
