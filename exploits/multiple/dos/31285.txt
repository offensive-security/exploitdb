Zilab Chat and Instant Messaging (ZIM) Server is prone to multiple vulnerabilities, including denial-of-service issues and memory-corruption issues.

A successful exploit may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected software and/or cause denial-of-service conditions.

These issues affect ZIM Server 2.0 and 2.1; other versions may also be affected.
