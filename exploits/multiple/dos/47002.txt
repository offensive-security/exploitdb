Summary and Impact
==================
A heap-based buffer overflow has been identified in the Thunderbird email
client. The issue is present in the libical implementation, which was forked
from upstream libical version 0.47.
The issue can be triggered remotely, when an attacker sends an specially
crafted calendar attachment and does not require user interaction. It
might be used by a remote attacker to crash or gain remote code execution
in the client system.
This issue was initially reported by Brandon Perry here:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1280832
and fixed in libical upstream, but was never fixed in Thunderbird.
X41 did not perform a full test or audit on the software.

Product Description
===================
Thunderbird is a free and open source email, newsfeed, chat, and calendaring
client, that's easy to set up and customize.

Analysis
========
A heap-based buffer overflow in icalvalue.c icalmemory_strdup_and_dequote()
can be triggered while parsing a calendar attachment containing a malformed
or specially crafted string.
{% highlight c %}
static char *icalmemorystrdupanddequote(const char *str)
{
    char *out = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char) * strlen(str) + 1);
    char *pout = out;
    // ...
    for (p = str; *p!=0; p++){
        if( *p == '\')
        {
            p++;
        // ...
        else
    {
            *pout = *p;
    }
    }
{% endhighlight %}
Bounds checking in `icalmemorystrdupanddequote()can be bypassed when the
inputp` ends with a backslash, which enables an attacker to read out of bounds
of the input buffer and writing out of bounds of a heap-allocated output buffer.
The issue manifests in several ways, including out of bounds read and write,
null-pointer dereference and frequently leads to heap corruption.
It is expected that an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to achieve
remote code execution.

A reproducer eml file can be found in https://github.com/x41sec/advisories/tree/master/X41-2019-001

Workarounds
===========
A fix is available from upstream. Alternatively, libical can be replaced by icaljs,
a JavaScript implementation of ical parsing, by setting
calendar.icaljs = true in Thunderbird configuration.
