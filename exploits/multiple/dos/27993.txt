FreeType is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability. This issue is due to a flaw in the library that causes a NULL-pointer dereference.

This issue allows remote attackers to crash applications that use the affected library, denying service to legitimate users.

FreeType versions prior to 2.2.1 are vulnerable to this issue.
