Unreal Tournament is a game produced by Epic Games, available for Microsoft Windows and Linux. Network play is supported. A vulnerability has been reported in the server used for network play.

It is possible to use an Unreal Tournament server as an amplifyer in a flooding attack, by transmiting multiple UDP packets with a spoofed victim IP address. The server will make repeated attempts to initiate a connection with the specified address, consuming network resources.
