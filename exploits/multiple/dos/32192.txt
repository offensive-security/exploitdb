Halo: Combat Evolved is prone to multiple remote denial-of-service vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly handle specially crafted network packets.

An attacker may exploit these issues to crash the affected application, denying service to legitimate users.

Halo: Combat Evolved 1.0.7.0615 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
