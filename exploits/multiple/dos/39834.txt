Two of the escape codes supported by the public ExtEscape() API are POSTSCRIPT_IDENTIFY and POSTSCRIPT_INJECTION, which are only processed if the Device Context is associated with a printer. In the code responsible for handling the two escape codes, we can find the following constructs:

--- cut ---
.text:7DAE3E9F                 mov     ecx, [ebp+cjInput]
.text:7DAE3EA2                 lea     eax, [ecx+1Ah]
.text:7DAE3EA5                 add     ecx, 17h
.text:7DAE3EA8                 cmp     eax, ecx
.text:7DAE3EAA                 jb      loc_7DAD19AD
.text:7DAE3EB0                 and     eax, 0FFFFFFFCh
.text:7DAE3EB3                 mov     [ebp+Size], eax
.text:7DAE3EB9                 push    [ebp+Size]      ; Size
.text:7DAE3EBF                 mov     eax, large fs:18h
.text:7DAE3EC5                 mov     eax, [eax+30h]
.text:7DAE3EC8                 push    0               ; Flags
.text:7DAE3ECA                 push    dword ptr [eax+18h] ; HeapHandle
.text:7DAE3ECD                 call    ds:__imp__RtlAllocateHeap@12 ; RtlAllocateHeap(x,x,x)
...
.text:7DAE3EEF                 mov     eax, [ebp+cjInput]
.text:7DAE3EF2                 push    eax             ; Size
.text:7DAE3EF3                 mov     [esi+10h], eax
.text:7DAE3EF6                 lea     eax, [esi+14h]
.text:7DAE3EF9                 push    edi             ; Src
.text:7DAE3EFA                 push    eax             ; Dst
.text:7DAE3EFB                 call    _memcpy
--- cut ---

which can be translated to the following C-like pseudocode (assuming 32-bit wide types):

--- cut ---
if (cjInput + 26 > cjInput > 23) {
  buffer = Allocate((cjInput + 26) & ~4);
  ...
  memcpy(buffer + 20, lpInData, cjInput);
  ...
}
--- cut ---

From the code snippet shown above, it is clear that while it checks for a possible integer overflow between cjInput+23 and cjInput+26, it does not check if the "+23" part overflows the 32-bit type or not. As a consequence, if cjInput is set to anywhere between -23 and -1, a small heap-based buffer will be allocated (<30 bytes) and the function will try to copy ~4GB of data into it, leading to an obvious buffer overflow condition.

Under normal circumstances, the problem can only be triggered with an unusually large value of the cjInput parameter, which is unlikely to be used by a programmer. However, EMF (Enhanced Windows Metafile) files can act as remote proxy for DrawEscape() (via EMR_DRAWESCAPE) and ExtEscape() (via EMR_EXTESCAPE) calls. Interestingly, the corresponding MRESCAPE::bCheckRecord() record verification routine doesn't ensure that the cjInput value is valid (i.e. that enough input data is actually present in the record). As a result, a specially crafted EMF file can pass any controlled value as cjInput, thus potentially /lying/ to ExtEscape() about the number of input bytes. Lack of cjInput sanitization in MRESCAPE::bCheckRecord() is therefore believed to be the culprit of the bug (regardless of the integer overflow in ExtEscape()).

While this is just one example of what an arbitrary cjInput parameter passed to DrawEscape() / ExtEscape() may lead to, we suspect that it could also have other security implications, e.g. if any of the functions trust cjInput and read beyond the record buffer, and then use the data in such a way that it is possible to retrieve it back in the client (like Internet Explorer), then it could be used as a memory disclosure primitive.

As previously mentioned, the bug only reproduces when the destination HDC is associated with a printer. After a brief search I haven't found a vector to achieve this using existing Windows client applications supporting the EMF format (such as IE), so I've developed a short dedicated program to demonstrate the problem (poc.cc), which boils down to the following API calls:

--- cut ---
HDC hdc = CreateDC("WINSPOOL", "Fax", NULL, NULL);
HENHMETAFILE hemf = GetEnhMetaFile("poc.emf");

RECT rect = {0, 0, 100, 100};
PlayEnhMetaFile(hdc, hemf, &rect);
--- cut ---

Upon compiling it and starting with the enclosed poc.emf file in the current working directory, the expected crash is generated in memcpy():

--- cut ---

The bug has been reproduced on a fully patched Windows 7 64-bit with a 32-bit POC program, but the 64-bit build of gdi32.dll also seems to be affected.
