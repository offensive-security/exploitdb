PHP Exif 64bit Casting Vulnerability
=====================================================================

Affected Software : PHP <= 5.3.5 (Exif extension for 64bit platforms)
Severity          : Low
Local/Remote      : Remote
Author            : @_ikki, @paradoxengine (blog.nibblesec.org)

[Summary]

PHP Exif extension allows developers to work with image metadata
within their PHP code. For instance, using exif functions it is possible
to read metadata from digital camera pictures.
For further details on this file format, please refer to:

PHP Exif extension for 64bit platforms is affected by a casting
vulnerability that occurs during the image header parsing.
According to our preliminary analysis, exploitation of this flaw results
in Denial of Service.

This vulnerability affects PHP 5.3.5 and likely all previous versions.
During our analysis, we have successfully tested our PoC against PHP
5.3.2, PHP 5.3.3 and the latest PHP release 5.3.5.

Using the following configuration, a system is most likely vulnerable:
 (a) PHP 64bit version
 (b) PHP compiled with --enable-exif
 (c) memory_limit = -1

[Vulnerability Details]

In case of 64bit platforms, an improper conversion occurs within
"/php-5.3.5/ext/exif/exif.c" at line 1100 (php_ifd_get32s) and 1118
(php_ifd_get32u).

In detail, an image having properly crafted Image File Directory (IFD)
can be used to trigger a segmentation fault caused by a memory access
violation:

Within the PoC image, bytes in position 358-35B can be used to craft
the value of the 'components' variable (int) which is later used within
memory read operations.

Two cases appear to be interesting:

{Case A - Negative value}
$hexdump -C ihaterepeating.jpeg | grep -i "03 00 00 A0"
results in "components=-1610612733"

{Case B - Positive value}
$hexdump -C ihaterepeating2.jpeg | grep -i "01 00 00 20"
results in "components=536870913"
Please note that 0x20 = 32dec

As mentioned, the value of the 'components' variable is later computed
in memory operations within another variable named 'length'.
Such value is used in a for-loop instruction (line 1745) to read image
metadata starting from a memory address.

Although it is possible to control the offset, the following
instructions (line 1671) limit such value to positive integers only.

 <-- cut here -->
if (length < 0) {
               return;
}
 <-- cut here -->

Consequently it seems possible to oversize the expected value only,
which results in a memory access violation.

[Proof-Of-Concept]

Two images (case A and B) have been properly crafted:
http://www.ikkisoft.com/stuff/ihaterepeating.jpeg
http://www.ikkisoft.com/stuff/ihaterepeating2.jpeg (SegFault)

You may want to use this script to read exif data:

 <-- cut here -->
 <?php
echo" --- start ---\n\n";
exif_read_data($argv[1]);
echo" --- end ---\n\n";
 ?>
 <-- cut here -->
