Call of Duty server is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied input before copying it to an insufficiently sized memory buffer.

Exploiting this issue may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary machine code in the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will likely cause denial-of-service conditions.
