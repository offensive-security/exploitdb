This issue was uncovered with AFL (http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/)

This infinite loop is caused by an offset of 0 being returned by wkh_content_disposition(). This offset of 0 prevents the while loop using "offset < tvb_len" from returning and results in an infinite loop.

This issue has been observed in both tshark 1.12.x and 2.0.x.
