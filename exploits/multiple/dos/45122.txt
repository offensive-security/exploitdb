There are several calls to memcpy that can overflow the destination buffer in webrtc::UlpfecReceiverImpl::AddReceivedRedPacket. The method takes a parameter incoming_rtp_packet, which is an RTP packet with a mac length that is defined by the transport (2048 bytes for DTLS in Chrome). This packet is then copied to the received_packet in several locations in the method, depending on packet properties, using the lenth of the incoming_rtp_packet as the copy length. The received_packet is a ForwardErrorCorrection::ReceivedPacket, which has a max size of 1500. Therefore, the memcpy calls in this method can overflow this buffer.

To reproduce this issue:

1) replace video/replay.cc with the attached version, and build it with asan (ninja -C out/asan video_replay). Note that this file adds the ability to load a full receiver config to the video replay tool, I'm hoping to eventually get this change committed to WebRTC.

2) Download the attached files config4.txt and fallbackoob1

3) run video_replay --input_file  fallbackoob1  --config_file config4.txt
