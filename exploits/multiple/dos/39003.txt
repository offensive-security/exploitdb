The following crash due to a stack-based buffer overflow can be observed in an ASAN build of Wireshark (current git master), by feeding a malformed file to tshark ("$ ./tshark -nVxr /path/to/file"):

Address 0x7ffc1c406210 is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 48 in frame
    #0 0x233fb4f in dissect_diameter_base_framed_ipv6_prefix wireshark/epan/dissectors/packet-diameter.c:504

  This frame has 2 object(s):
    [32, 48) 'value'
    [64, 80) 'addr' <== Memory access at offset 48 partially underflows this variable
HINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism or swapcontext
      (longjmp and C++ exceptions *are* supported)
