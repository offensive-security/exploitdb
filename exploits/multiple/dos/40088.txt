There is a heap overflow when loading the attacked JXR file in Adobe Flash. To reproduce, load the attached file using LoadImage.swf?img=12.atf.

This issue can be a bit difficult to reproduce, as the crash occurs when the player is destroyed, so the crash screen doesn't always show up on the Player. The easiest way to detect the issue is to attach a debugger to the Player and refresh a few times.

Took a closer look at this, it is a UaF of plane->model_hp_buffer in the open-source JXR component.
