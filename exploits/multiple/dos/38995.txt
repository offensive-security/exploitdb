The crash was reported at https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11830. Attached are three files which trigger the crash.

Update: there is also a similar crash due to out-of-bounds access to the global "ett_zbee_zcl_pwr_prof_enphases" array, see the report below.

Attached is a file which triggers the crash.
