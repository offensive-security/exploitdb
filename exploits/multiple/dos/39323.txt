The following crash due to a stack-based buffer overflow can be observed in an ASAN build of Wireshark (current git master), by feeding a malformed file to tshark ("$ ./tshark -nVxr /path/to/file"):

  This frame has 2 object(s):
    [32, 302) 'buf' <== Memory access at offset 302 overflows this variable
    [368, 377) 'protocol'
HINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism or swapcontext
