Sniper Elite is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability because of a NULL-pointer dereference error.

Successful exploits may allow remote attackers to cause denial-of-service conditions. Given the nature of this issue, attackers may also be able to run arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

Versions prior to Sniper Elite 1.0 are vulnerable.
