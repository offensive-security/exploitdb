A remote denial of service vulnerability reportedly affects Digital Illusions CE Codename Eagle. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly handle exceptional network data.

An attacker may leverage this issue to cause the affected application to stop responding to network-based messages, effectively denying service to legitimate, remote users. Due to the nature of the network protocol used by the affected application an attacker may spoof their network identity, facilitating anonymous exploitation.
