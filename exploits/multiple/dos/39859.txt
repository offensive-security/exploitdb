The following crash due to a heap-based buffer overflow can be observed in a slightly modified ASAN build of the standard Graphite2 gr2FontTest utility (git trunk), triggered with the following command:

$ ./gr2fonttest /path/to/file text

My change in gr2FontTest was to hardcode the tested text to include all characters in the 0x1..0xfff range, instead of having to specify them in command line. The patch is as follows:

A cursory analysis shows that the direct reason of the crash is the wrong assumption made by GlyphCache::GlyphCache() that the _num_glyphs field is always greater than 0. A buffer is allocated in line 128:

--- cut ---
   128	        GlyphFace * const glyphs = new GlyphFace [_num_glyphs];
--- cut ---

And regardless of the _num_glyphs value, data is written to its first entry in line 133:

--- cut ---
   132	        // The 0 glyph is definately required.
   133	        _glyphs[0] = _glyph_loader->read_glyph(0, glyphs[0], &numsubs);
--- cut ---

While this could just end as an off-by-one error and a fixed ~8 byte overflow, it gets worse. The subsequent loop in lines 139-140 also assumes that _num_glyphs is non-zero, and additionally wrongly (in the context of the misassumption) uses the != operator instead of < in the loop end condition:

--- cut ---
   138	        const GlyphFace * loaded = _glyphs[0];
   139	        for (uint16 gid = 1; loaded && gid != _num_glyphs; ++gid)
   140	            _glyphs[gid] = loaded = _glyph_loader->read_glyph(gid, glyphs[gid], &numsubs);
--- cut ---

This essentially means that the size of the overflown area is fully controlled by an attacker; it must only be a multiple of the native word size: typically 4 or 8 bytes.
