The attached file crashes in CmdExtract::UnstoreFile because the signed int64 DestUnpSize is truncated to an unsigned 32bit integer. Perhaps CmdExtract::ExtractCurrentFile should sanity check Arc.FileHead.UnpSize early.

I observed this crash in Avast Antivirus, but the origin of the code appears to be the unrar source distribution. I imagine many other antiviruses will be affected, and presumably WinRAR and other archivers.
