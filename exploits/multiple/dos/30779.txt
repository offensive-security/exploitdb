Rigs of Rods is prone to a remote buffer-overflow because the application fails to bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it into an insufficiently sized buffer.

An attacker could exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial of service.

This issue affects Rigs of Rods 0.33d and prior versions.
