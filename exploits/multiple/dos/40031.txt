A major component of the Symantec Antivirus scan engine is the "Decomposer", responsible for unpacking various archive formats such as ZIP, RAR, and so on. The decomposer runs as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM on Windows, and root on Linux and Mac. It is self-evident from looking at the decomposer code that Symantec have based the RAR decompression on the open-source unrar package from RAR labs (Note: this is permitted by the unrar license).

By comparing Symantec's code to the open source code, I have determined that Symantec are probably using version 4.1.4 of the unrar code, released in January 2012. The most current version is version 5.3.11.

Between the version of unrar that Symantec runs as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM to unpack untrusted binaries received over the network and the the current version, literally hundreds of critical memory corruption bugs have been resolved.

I have verified that multiple publicly known vulnerabilities affect Symantec, and can result in remote code execution as NT AUTHORTITY\SYSTEM on Windows and root on Linux and Mac.

I have verified this on the following products:

    Norton Antivirus, Windows
    Symantec Endpoint Protection, Linux and Windows
    Symantec Scan Engine, Linux and Windows

Presumably this affects all other Symantec products using the core Symantec scan engine.

In my opinion, I'm being exceptionally generous considering this issue a new vulnerability and not public information. Frankly, it is astonishing that Symantec do not track new releases of third party code they use. I think you should take this opportunity to check all other third party code you're using to verify you haven't fallen behind.

I've attached a trivial example that modifies an arbitrary index in the PlaceA[] array via Unpack::ShortLZ().

These bugs are obviously exploitable for remote code execution on all Symantec customer machines as root or SYSTEM.
