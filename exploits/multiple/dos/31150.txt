RPM Remote Print Manager is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied input before copying it into an insufficiently sized buffer.

An attacker may exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code or cause denial-of-service conditions.

The issue affects RPM Elite and Select 4.5.1.11 and prior versions.
