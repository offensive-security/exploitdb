The Ghost Recon Game Engine has been reported prone to a denial of service vulnerability. When handling text strings, the Ghost Recon Game Engine employs a 32-bit integer string size prefix in order to monitor the size of the string. It has been reported that when an invalid size value is supplied an exception will be triggered causing a system wide denial of service.
