The dec2lha library is the library responsible for decompressing LZH and LHA archives. The CSymLHA::get_header() routine has a trivial stack buffer overflow.

.text:00023D91 31 C0                          xor     eax, eax
...
.text:00023DAE 8D 95 E4 FB FF+                lea     edx, [ebp+var_41C]
.text:00023DB4 89 D7                          mov     edi, edx
.text:00023DC7 66 B9 00 01                    mov     cx, 100h
.text:00023DCB F3 AB                          rep stosd

We can see from this initialization that var_141C is a 1024 byte stack buffer, because 0x100 * sizeof(dword) = 1024. But later on in this routine:

.text:0002442C 88 0C 10                       mov     [eax+edx], cl ; eax = &var_41C edx=index
.text:0002442F 83 C2 01                       add     edx, 1 ; edx++
...
.text:00024408 81 FA 00 10 00+                cmp     edx, 1000h ; if (index > 4096) ...
.text:0002440E 0F 84 E9 02 00+                jz      loc_246FD ; oob

The index is checked to see if it's > 4096 bytes, this is incorrect. This is most likely a simple programmers error, bounds checking with the wrong size.

This code is typically run with SYSTEM/root privileges, I'm using Symantec Scan Engine on Linux to reproduce this issue, but all platforms and products using this code (e.g. Symantec Mail Security) are likely affected.

Because Symantec do not use -fstack-protector on Linux, exploitation is remarkably trivial. Exploitation is likely still possible on Windows, but may be more difficult as they do use /GS on that platform.

This issue is remotely exploitable just by receiving an email, visiting a website, and so on.
