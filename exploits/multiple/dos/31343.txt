Sun Java Runtime Environment is prone to a heap-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will likely crash the application.

This issue affects the following products and versions:

JDK and JRE 6 prior to Update 5
JDK and JRE 5.0 prior to Update 15
SDK and JRE prior to 1.4.2_17
SDK and JRE prior to 1.3.1_22

This vulnerability was previously covered in BID 28083 (Sun Java SE Multiple Security Vulnerabilities), but has been given its own record to better document the issue.
