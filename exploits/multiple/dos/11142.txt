ScaryMovie Exploit Study
By: Dr_IDE
October, 2009

There is a widespread failure in the way that (.MOV) files are handled by the Quicktime Library. I have attempted to compound my findings on this issue.

Nearly every (.MOV) enabled application that I tested fell victim to this exploit. This is a local memory corruption vulnerability in the way these programs process a malformed file. I have provided crash logs, register dumps where applicable, sample script and trigger file.

Memory Corruption is repeatable and code execution seems possible. Because this issue affects web browsers it seems that the attack vector will be both Local and Remote.

It should be noted these applications are all registered by default as registered applications for this file type. There is no trickery involved in order to enable these programs to open the malicious file.
