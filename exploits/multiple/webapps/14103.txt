These vulnerabilities were discovered during WAF testing by Sandro Gauci of
EnableSecurity. We contacted AppliCure on May 17, 2010 about this vulnerability.
They were already working on a fix.

____________________________________________________________________________

Technical details:

The log viewer facility in dotDefender does not properly htmlencode user
supplied input. This leads to a cross site scripting vulnerability when the log
viewer displays HTTP headers.

____________________________________________________________________________

Demo:

One may use curl and insert headers containing html tags using the --header
switch.
Example:

    curl "http://website.org/c?a=<script>" \
    --header "<script>alert(1)</script>: aa"

When the administrator views the log viewer page, his/her web browser will
execute the attacker's javascript.

The following demo shows how an attacker can switch off dotDefender in order to
bypass any "protection" offered by the WAF:
