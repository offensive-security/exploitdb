Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the SharkFood Air Gallery 1.0 Air Photo Browser mobile application for Apple iOS.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2013-12-09:    Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
SharkFood
Product: Air Gallery - Air Photo Browser iOS 1.0


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
A local command/path injection web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the SharkFood Air Gallery 1.0 Air Photo Browser mobile application for Apple iOS.
A local command inject vulnerability allows attackers to inject local commands via vulnerable system values to compromise the apple mobile iOS application.

The vulnerability is located in the vulnerable `devicename` value of the file dir und sub category `header` (header-title) section. Local attackers are
able to inject own malicious system specific commands or path value requests as the physical iOS hardware devicename. The execute of the injected
command or path request occurs with persistent attack vector in the index and sub category list of the web interface. The security risk of the local
command/path inject vulnerability is estimated as high(-) with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.5(+)|(-)6.6.

Exploitation of the command/path inject vulnerability requires a low privileged iOS device account with restricted access and no user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized execute of system specific commands or unauthorized path requests.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Content > header-title

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] devicename

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index- File Dir Listing
				[+] Sub Folder/Category - File Dir Listing



1.2
A local command/path injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the SharkFood Air Gallery 1.0 Air Photo Browser mobile application for Apple iOS.
A local command inject vulnerability allows attackers to inject local commands via vulnerable system values to compromise the apple mobile iOS application.

The second local command/path inject vulnerability is located in the in the album name value of the web-interface index and sub category list module.
Local attackers are able to manipulate iOS device `photo app` (default) album names by the inject of a payload to the wrong encoded albumname input fields.
The execute of the injected command/path request occurs in the album sub category list and the main album name index list. The security risk of the
command/path inject vulnerabilities are estimated as high(-) with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.6(+).

Exploitation of the command/path inject vulnerability requires a local low privileged iOS device account with restricted access and no direct user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results unauthorized execution of system specific commands or unauthorized path requests.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Poster > group-header > groupinfo

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] album name

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index - Item Name List
				[+] Sub Category - Title List


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
1.1
The local command/path inject web vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with restricted or low privileged device user account
without user interaction. For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below.


1. Install the vulnerable mobile application to your ios device (iphone, mac or ipad)
2. Open the settings menu in the mobile iOS and click the info button to have an influence on the devicename value
3. Now change the local devicename value to your own script code with a frame + local command inject settings or path request
4. Save the settings and open the vulnerable mobile application
5. Start the web-server via wifi (standard localhost:8080 passwd:empty)
6. Open with another computer via browser the local service, the local command inject or unauthorized path request occurs in the header section
7. Successful reproduce of the local command/path inject vulnerability!

1.2
The local command/path inject web vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with restricted or low privileged device user account
without user interaction. For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below.


1. Install the vulnerable mobile application to your ios device (iphone, mac or ipad)
2. Open the default photo app in the mobile iOS and click the edit or add button to have an influence on the local albumname value
Note: Now the attackers is able to change an exisiting albumname or can add a new album (name)
3. Include your own script code with a frame + local command inject settings or unauthorized path request
4. Save the settings and open the vulnerable mobile application
5. Start the web-server via wifi (standard localhost:8080 passwd:empty)
6. Open with another computer via web-browser the local service (GET method - index)
Note: The local command inject or unauthorized path request occurs in the groupinfo of the group-header section
7. Successful reproduce of the local command/path inject vulnerability!


PoC: Poster > group-header > groupinfo

<div class="col1">
<div style="display: block;" id="group-header" class="content ui-helper-hidden">
<img id="group-poster" class="control-button" src="/api/poster/?group=0&subgroup=0">

</div><div style="height: 380.6px;" id="group-content" class="content airGallery">
There are no photos in this album</div>

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
1.1
The first local command/path inject web vulnerability can be patched by a secure encode and parse of the vulnerable devicename value in
the web interface header section.

1.2
The second local command/path inject web vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse of the vulnerable albumname value
in the web interface data context listing section.


Security Risk:
==============
1.1
The security risk of the local command/path inject web vulnerability is estimated as high(-).
Local attackers are able to inject own system specific commands but can also unatuhorized request local system path values to
compromise the apple iOS web-application.

1.2
The security risk of the second local command/path inject web vulnerability is estimated as high(-). Local attackers are able to
inject own system specific commands but can also unatuhorized request local system path values to
compromise the apple iOS web-application.
