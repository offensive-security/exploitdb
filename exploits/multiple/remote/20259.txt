source: https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1749/info

The 'rpc.ypupdated' deamon is part of the Network Information Service (NIS) or Yellow Pages (YP). It allows clients to update NIS maps. A vulnerability in 'rpc.ypupdated' allows a malicious user to execute commands as root.

After receiving a request to update the Yello Pages maps, 'ypupdated' executes a copy of the bource shell to run the 'make' command to recompute the maps whether the request for changes was sucessful or not. Because of bad input validation while executing 'make', an attacker can pass shell metacharacters to the shell and can execute commands.

This is issue is tracked by Sun BugIDs 1230027 and 1232146.
