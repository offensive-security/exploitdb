RDM Embedded is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data. The issue affects the 'lm_tcp' service.

Successful exploits may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of a user running an application that uses the affected library. Failed exploit attempts may crash the application, denying service to legitimate users.

The issue affects lm_tcp <= 9.0.0 0248.18.0.0; other versions may also be affected.
