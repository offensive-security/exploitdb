Successfully poisoned the latest BIND with fully randomized ports!

Exploit required to send more than 130 thousand of requests for the fake records like
131737-4795-15081.blah.com to be able to match port and ID and insert poisoned entry
for the poisoned_dns.blah.com.

# dig @localhost www.blah.com +norecurse

BIND 9.5.0-P2

BIND used fully randomized source port range, i.e. around 64000 ports.
Two attacking servers, connected to the attacked one via GigE link, were used,
each one attacked 1-2 ports with full ID range. Usually attacking server is able
to send about 40-50 thousands fake replies before remote server returns the
correct one, so if port was matched probability of the successful poisoning is more than 60%.

Attack took about half of the day, i.e. a bit less than 10 hours.
So, if you have a GigE lan, any trojaned machine can poison your DNS during one night...
