The Bontago game server is reported to be affected by a remote buffer overrun vulnerability. The issue is reported to exist due to a lack of sufficient boundary checks performed on client-supplied 'nickname' values.

It is conjectured that a remote attacker may exploit this vulnerability to influence execution flow of a target game server and have arbitrary supplied instructions executed in the context of the affected process.

This vulnerability is reported to exist in Bontago versions up to an including version 1.1.
