Vilistextum is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is exposed when the application parses HTML attributes while converting an HTML file to text/ASCII. Since HTML files will likely originate from an external or untrusted source, this issue should be considered remote in nature.

Successful exploitation will allow for execution of arbitrary code in the context of the user running the application.
