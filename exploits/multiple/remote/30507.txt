The gMotor2 game engine is prone to multiple code-execution and denial-of-service vulnerabilities. Four vulnerabilities were reported.

These vulnerabilities may be triggered by malicious client requests to games that use the affected engine, including rFactor. Successful exploits could crash a game server or let remote attackers execute arbitrary code on the computer hosting affected software.

NOTE: This BID originally stated that the vulnerabilities were in the rFactor game. New information shows that the gMotor2 game engine and multiple games that use the engine are vulnerable. This BID was updated to reflect this new information.
