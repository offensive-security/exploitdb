Feng is prone to multiple remote buffer-overflow and denial-of-service vulnerabilities.

Successfully exploiting these issues allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the server application. Attackers may also crash the application, denying service to legitimate users.

Feng 0.1.15 is vulnerable to these issues; other versions may also be affected.
