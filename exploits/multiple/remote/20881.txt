The IPC@Chip is a single-chip embedded webserver from Beck GmbH.

The device's inbuilt telnetd service may allow a remote user to repeatedly attempt to login to a given account, without logging or responding to repeated failed login attempts. This could permit an attacker to brute-force a known account name, potentially leading to a compromise of the device's accounts and/or allowing a compromise of its function.
