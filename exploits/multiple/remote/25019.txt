It is reported that abc2midi is susceptible to two stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure of the application to properly bounds check user-supplied image data prior to copying it into fixed-size memory buffers.

These vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to alter the proper flow of execution of the application, potentially resulting in the execution of attacker-supplied machine code in the context of the application attempting to read malicious ABC files.
