#Version: v7
#Tested on: Linux, Windows

# I. Problem Description

#In the latest version of myPRO (v7), it has been discovered that the ftp server's -running on port 2121-  username and password information is kept in the file by using reverse engineering. Anyone who connects to an FTP server with an authorized account can upload or download files onto the server running myPRO software.

# II. Technical 

Hardcoded username:password = myscada:Vikuk63

#Firstly, I found that what ports myPRO listened to. You can get information used by the netstat command about the ports and the services running on it. When you install myPRO, you can see many ports open. The vulnerability works on all supported platforms.

#In my first research on the Windows OS, myPRO has many process and I noticed that ‘myscadagate.exe’ is listening to port #2121. 

#I found that they put the username and password (myscada:Vikuk63) in the source code. I obtained access by connecting to port 2121 of myPRO's server with any FTP client.

# III. Solution

#As a workaround you need to restrict port 2121 access from the outside. There is no permanent solution for the vendor because there is no patch available.
