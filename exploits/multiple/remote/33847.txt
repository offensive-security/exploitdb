netkar-PRO is prone to a remote stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to properly bounds-check messages before copying them to an insufficiently sized memory buffer.

Successful exploits can allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary machine code in the context of the user running the application.

netkar-PRO 1.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
