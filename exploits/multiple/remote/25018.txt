abc2mtex is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is exposed when the program is used to convert ABC music notation files to MTEX format. In particular, the issue is due to insufficient bounds checking of key data in ABC notation files. Since the ABC files may originate from an external or untrusted source, this issue is considered remote in nature.

Successful exploitation will result in execution of arbitrary code in the context of the user running the application.
