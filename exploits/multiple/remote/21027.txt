Sambar Server is a multi-threaded HTTP server for Microsoft Windows and Unix systems.

Sambar Server provides insecure default protection for user passwords.

The default password decryption algorithm employs only a single key, built into the server binary. If the key is recovered, user passwords may be extracted.

Compromise of the webserver's passwords could allow a local attacker to compromise the website's design and function, obtain confidential or security-sensitive information which could lead to further compromises of the host.
