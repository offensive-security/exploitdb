CVE-2018-15685 - Electron WebPreferences Remote Code Execution
This is a minimal Electron application with a POC for CVE-2018-15685.

A remote code execution vulnerability has been discovered affecting apps with the ability to open nested child windows on Electron versions (3.0.0-beta.6, 2.0.7, 1.8.7, and 1.7.15). This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2018-15685.

For more information see my full write up on the Contrast Security blog (https://www.contrastsecurity.com/security-influencers/cve-2018-15685) or the write up on the offical blog from Electron (https://electronjs.org/blog/web-preferences-fix)

The project contains the fillowing files:

main.js - This is the app's main process. Note this has nodeIntegration disabled so it should not be possibe use "process"
index.html - This is an example rendered page. This could be remotely controlled URL, or a page from an application with an XSS. In this example even though it is a local file but should not have access to node bindings.
You can learn more about each of these components within the Quick Start Guide.
