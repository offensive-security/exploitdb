DConnect Daemon is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because the library fails to do proper boundary checks before copying user-supplied data into a finite-sized buffer.

This issue allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application or cause the application to crash causing a denial of service.

Version 0.7.0, CVS July 30th 2006 and prior versions are vulnerable to this issue.
