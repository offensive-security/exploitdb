Bits Video Script is prone to multiple arbitrary-file-upload vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to upload arbitrary code and run it in the context of the webserver process. This may facilitate unauthorized access or privilege escalation; other attacks are also possible.

Bits Video Script 2.04 and 2.05 Gold Beta are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
