phpBB is affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability.

This issue is due to the application failing to properly sanitize user-supplied input during authentication.

Exploitation of this vulnerability would permit unauthorized access to any known account including the administrator account.

The vendor has addressed this issue in phpBB 2.0.13.
