xt:Commerce is prone to multiple vulnerabilities, including a session-fixation vulnerability and a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

An attacker can leverage the session-fixation issue to hijack a session of an unsuspecting user. The attacker can exploit the cross-site scripting issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

xt:Commerce 3.04 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
