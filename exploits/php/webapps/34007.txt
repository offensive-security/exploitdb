Affected parameter(s): entity

Steps to replicate:
1.	Login into Dolibarr application with any user and go to "Users & Group" --> "User Card".
2.	Click on modify to modify the user details
3.	Start any interception tool to intercept the request i.e. tamper data mozilla addon, burp suite, owasp zap etc. I have used mozilla firefox browser and tamper data addon.
4.	After starting tamper data addon, click on save to save the user details and intercept the request
5.	Manipulate entity parameter original value 1 with 1' and submit the request and see the output in browser
6.	A single quote was submitted in the entity parameter, and a database error message was returned that is the proof of vulnerability

Remediation detail: The application should handle errors gracefully and prevent SQL error messages from being returned in responses.
Issue background: SQL injection vulnerabilities arise when user-controllable data is incorporated into database SQL queries in an unsafe manner. An attacker can supply crafted input to break out of the data context in which their input appears and interfere with the structure of the surrounding query.  Various attacks can be delivered via SQL injection, including reading or modifying critical application data, interfering with application logic, escalating privileges within the database and executing operating system commands.
Tools used: Mozilla Firefox browser and Tamper Data Addon

Remediation detail: In most situations where user-controllable data is copied into application responses, Link Injection attacks can be prevented using two layers of defenses:
•	Input should be validated as strictly as possible on arrival, given the kind of content which it is expected to contain. For example, personal names should consist of alphabetical and a small range of typographical characters, and be relatively short; a year of birth should consist of exactly four numerals; email addresses should match a well-defined regular expression. Input which fails the validation should be rejected, not sanitized.
•	User input should be HTML-encoded at any point where it is copied into application responses. All HTML metacharacters, including < > " ' and =, should be replaced with the corresponding HTML entities (< > etc).

Issue details: The value of the dol_hide_leftmenu request parameter is copied into the value of an HTML tag attribute which is encapsulated in double quotation marks. The payload 6ddc8"><img src=a onerror=alert(1)>f1fc4 was submitted in the dol_hide_leftmenu parameter. This input was echoed unmodified in the application's response.

This proof-of-concept attack demonstrates that it is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the application's response. The proof-of-concept attack demonstrated uses an event handler to introduce arbitrary JavaScript into the document.

In cases where the application's functionality allows users to author content using a restricted subset of HTML tags and attributes (for example, blog comments which allow limited formatting and linking), it is necessary to parse the supplied HTML to validate that it does not use any dangerous syntax; this is a non-trivial task.
Issue background: Reflected cross-site scripting vulnerabilities arise when data is copied from a request and echoed into the application's immediate response in an unsafe way. An attacker can use the vulnerability to construct a request which, if issued by another application user, will cause JavaScript code supplied by the attacker to execute within the user's browser in the context of that user's session with the application.  The attacker-supplied code can perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing the victim's session token or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on the victim's behalf, and logging their keystrokes.

Steps to replicate:
16.	Open Dolibarr application in browser.

19.	Manipulate dol_optimize_smallscreen parameter value with payload 19600"><img%20src%3da%20onerror%3dalert(1)>6f8bd and submit the request and see the output in browser
20.	This input was echoed unmodified in the application's response that is the proof of vulnerability

Remediation detail: In most situations where user-controllable data is copied into application responses, cross-site scripting attacks can be prevented using two layers of defenses:
•	Input should be validated as strictly as possible on arrival, given the kind of content which it is expected to contain. For example, personal names should consist of alphabetical and a small range of typographical characters, and be relatively short; a year of birth should consist of exactly four numerals; email addresses should match a well-defined regular expression. Input which fails the validation should be rejected, not sanitized.
•	User input should be HTML-encoded at any point where it is copied into application responses. All HTML metacharacters, including < > " ' and =, should be replaced with the corresponding HTML entities (< > etc).
In cases where the application's functionality allows users to author content using a restricted subset of HTML tags and attributes (for example, blog comments which allow limited formatting and linking), it is necessary to parse the supplied HTML to validate that it does not use any dangerous syntax; this is a non-trivial task.
Issue background: Reflected cross-site scripting vulnerabilities arise when data is copied from a request and echoed into the application's immediate response in an unsafe way. An attacker can use the vulnerability to construct a request which, if issued by another application user, will cause JavaScript code supplied by the attacker to execute within the user's browser in the context of that user's session with the application.  The attacker-supplied code can perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing the victim's session token or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on the victim's behalf, and logging their keystrokes.

An attacker can use the vulnerability to construct a request which, if issued by another application user, will cause JavaScript code supplied by the attacker to execute within the user's browser in the context of that user's session with the application.  The attacker-supplied code can perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing the victim's session token or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on the victim's behalf, and logging their keystrokes.

Remediation detail: In most situations where user-controllable data is copied into application responses, cross-site scripting attacks can be prevented using two layers of defenses:
•	Input should be validated as strictly as possible on arrival, given the kind of content which it is expected to contain. For example, personal names should consist of alphabetical and a small range of typographical characters, and be relatively short; a year of birth should consist of exactly four numerals; email addresses should match a well-defined regular expression. Input which fails the validation should be rejected, not sanitized.
•	User input should be HTML-encoded at any point where it is copied into application responses. All HTML metacharacters, including < > " ' and =, should be replaced with the corresponding HTML entities (< > etc).
In cases where the application's functionality allows users to author content using a restricted subset of HTML tags and attributes (for example, blog comments which allow limited formatting and linking), it is necessary to parse the supplied HTML to validate that it does not use any dangerous syntax; this is a non-trivial task.

GET /dolibarr/viewimage.php?modulepart=userphoto%3cscript%3ealert%2892207%29%3c%2fscript%3e&entity=1&file=2%2F0%2F1234&cache=0 HTTP/1.0
Cookie: DOLSESSID_636e2e420d10c4a9056d9a4aacf317fb=t2h9dudaj2qm7vp2skgkhpgs94
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Win32)
Host: localhost
Referer: http://localhost/dolibarr/user/fiche.php?id=2

Affected parameter(s): modulepart

Steps to replicate:
36.	Open Dolibarr application in browser.
37.	Start any interception tool to intercept the request i.e. tamper data mozilla addon, burp suite, owasp zap etc. I have used mozilla firefox browser and tamper data addon.
38.	After starting tamper data addon, fill login details and click on connection button to login into application and intercept the request
39.	Manipulate modulepart parameter value with payload %3cscript%3ealert%2892207%29%3c%2fscript%3e
or submit http://localhost/dolibarr/viewimage.php?modulepart=userphoto%3cscript%3ealert%2892207%29%3c%2fscript%3e&entity=1&file=2%2F0%2F1234&cache=0 in address bar and see the output in browser
40.	This input was echoed unmodified in the application's response that is the proof of vulnerability

Remediation detail: In most situations where user-controllable data is copied into application responses, cross-site scripting attacks can be prevented using two layers of defenses:
•	Input should be validated as strictly as possible on arrival, given the kind of content which it is expected to contain. For example, personal names should consist of alphabetical and a small range of typographical characters, and be relatively short; a year of birth should consist of exactly four numerals; email addresses should match a well-defined regular expression. Input which fails the validation should be rejected, not sanitized.
•	User input should be HTML-encoded at any point where it is copied into application responses. All HTML metacharacters, including < > " ' and =, should be replaced with the corresponding HTML entities (< > etc).
In cases where the application's functionality allows users to author content using a restricted subset of HTML tags and attributes (for example, blog comments which allow limited formatting and linking), it is necessary to parse the supplied HTML to validate that it does not use any dangerous syntax; this is a non-trivial task.
Issue background: Reflected cross-site scripting vulnerabilities arise when data is copied from a request and echoed into the application's immediate response in an unsafe way. An attacker can use the vulnerability to construct a request which, if issued by another application user, will cause JavaScript code supplied by the attacker to execute within the user's browser in the context of that user's session with the application.  The attacker-supplied code can perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing the victim's session token or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on the victim's behalf, and logging their keystrokes.

Vulnerability Name: Cross-site scripting (reflected)

Severity: Critical

URL: http://localhost/dolibarr/viewimage.php
Affected Users: All authenticated users

Issue details: The value of the file request parameter is copied into a JavaScript string which is encapsulated in single quotation marks. The payload 2%2F0%2F1234%3cscript%3ealert%2893275%29%3c%2fscript%3e was submitted in the modulepart parameter. This input was echoed unmodified in the application's response.
