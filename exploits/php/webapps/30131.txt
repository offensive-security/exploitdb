Buttercup WFM (Web File Manager) is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

This issue is reported to affect the Buttercup WFM - May 2007 edition. Other versions could also be affected.
