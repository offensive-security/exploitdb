[RCESEC-2016-002] XenAPI v1.4.1 for XenForo Multiple Unauthenticated SQL Injections

RCE Security Advisory
https://www.rcesecurity.com


1. ADVISORY INFORMATION
=======================
Product:        XenAPI for XenForo
Vendor URL:     github.com/Contex/XenAPI
Type:           SQL Injection [CWE-89]
Date found:     2016-05-20
Date published: 2016-05-23
CVSSv3 Score:   7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
CVE:            -


2. CREDITS
==========
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
RCE Security.


3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
====================
XenAPI for XenForo v1.4.1
older versions may be affected too but were not tested.


4. INTRODUCTION
===============
This Open Source REST API allows usage of several of XenForo's functions,
such as authentication, user information and many other functions!

(from the vendor's homepage)


5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
The plugin "XenAPI" for XenForo offers a REST Api with different functions
to query and edit information from the XenForo database backend. Amongst
those are "getGroup" and "getUsers", which can be called without
authentication (default) and since the application does not properly
validate and sanitize the "value" parameter, it is possible to inject
arbitrary SQL commands into the XenForo backend database.

The following proof-of-concepts exploit each vulnerable REST action
and extract the hostname of the server:

https://127.0.0.1/api.php?action=getUsers&value=' UNION ALL SELECT
CONCAT(IFNULL(CAST(%40%40HOSTNAME AS CHAR)%2C0x20))%2CNULL%23

https://127.0.0.1/api.php?action=getGroup&value=' UNION ALL SELECT
NULL%2CNULL%2CNULL%2CNULL%2CNULL%2CCONCAT(IFNULL(CAST(%40%40HOSTNAME AS
CHAR)%2C0x20))%2CNULL%23


6. RISK
=======
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to read sensitive information
from the XenForo database like usernames and passwords. Since the affected
REST actions do not require an authentication hash, these vulnerabilities
can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.


7. SOLUTION
===========
Update to the latest version v1.4.2
