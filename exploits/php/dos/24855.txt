PHP4 and PHP5 are reported prone to multiple local and remote vulnerabilities that may lead to code execution within the context of the vulnerable process. The following specific issues are reported:

A heap-based buffer overflow is reported to affect the PHP 'pack()' function call. An attacker that has the ability to make the PHP interpreter run a malicious script may exploit this condition to execute arbitrary instructions in the context of the vulnerable process.

A heap-based memory disclosure vulnerability is reported to affect the PHP 'unpack()' function call. An attacker that has the ability to make the PHP interpreter run a malicious script may exploit this condition to reveal portions of the process heap.

PHP safe_mode_exec_dir is reported prone to an access control bypass vulnerability. A local attacker that can manipulate the directory name from which the PHP script is called, may bypass 'safe_mode_exec_dir' restrictions by placing shell metacharacters and restricted commands into the directory name of the current directory.

PHP safe_mode is reported prone to an access control bypass vulnerability. An attacker that has the ability to make the PHP interpreter run a malicious script may exploit this condition to execute commands that are otherwise restricted by PHP safe_mode.

PHP is reported prone to a 'realpath()' path truncation vulnerability. The vulnerability exists due to a lack of sanitization as to whether a path has been silently truncated by the libc realpath() function or not. This may lead to remote file include vulnerabilities in some cases.

The PHP function 'unserialize()' is reported prone to a memory corruption vulnerability. This corruption may be leveraged by a remote attacker that has the ability to make the PHP interpreter run a malicious script to execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable process.

The PHP function 'unserialize()' is also reported prone to an information disclosure vulnerability. This issue may be leveraged by a remote attacker to disclose the contents of heap memory. This may allow them to gain access to potentially sensitive information, such as database credentials.

Finally, the PHP function 'unserialize()', is reported prone to an additional vulnerability. It is reported that previous versions of this function allow a malicious programmer to set references to entries of a variable hash that have already been freed. This can lead to remote memory corruption.
