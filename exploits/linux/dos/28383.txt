ImageMagick is prone to a remote heap buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied input before copying it to an insufficiently sized memory buffer.

This issue allows attackers to execute arbitrary machine code in the context of applications that use the ImageMagick library.

ImageMagick versions in the 6.x series, up to version 6.2.8, are vulnerable to this issue.
