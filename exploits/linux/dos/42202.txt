I have been fuzzing objdump with American Fuzzy Lop and AddressSanitizer.

Please find attached the minimized file causing the issue ("Input") and the
ASAN report log ("Output"). Below is the reduced stacktrace with links to the
corresponding source lines on a GitHub mirror.

The command I used was `objdump -D <file>`.

Let me know if there is any additional information I can provide.
