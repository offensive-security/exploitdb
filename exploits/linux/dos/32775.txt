The Linux kernel is prone to a local denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to properly handle malformed filesystem images.

Attackers can exploit this issue to cause the kernel to crash, denying service to legitimate users. Note that to exploit this issue, attackers must be able to mount appropriate filesystem types, which may require membership in a privileged group or root access.

This issue affects versions prior to Linux kernel 2.6.27.14.
