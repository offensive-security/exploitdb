It has been reported that the GameSpy SDK is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability in its CD-key validation functionality. This issue is due to a failure of the SDK to properly check the length of user-supplied network data prior to copying it to a fixed-sized memory buffer.

Exploitation of this issue may allow attackers to execute arbitrary machine code in the context of the affected GameSpy developed game.
