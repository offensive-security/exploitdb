OpenSSL is prone to a remote memory-corruption vulnerability.

Successfully exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application using the vulnerable library. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

The issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.0a; other versions may also be affected.
