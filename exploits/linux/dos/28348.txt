ClamAV is prone to a heap buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it to an insufficiently sized memory buffer.

This issue occurs when the application attempts to handle compressed UPX files.

Exploiting this issue could allow attacker-supplied machine code to execute in the context of the affected application. The issue would occur when the malformed file is scanned manually or automatically in deployments such as email gateways.

ClamAV versions 0.88.2 and 0.88.3 are vulnerable to this issue; prior versions may also be affected.
