LibTIFF is prone to a remote buffer-underflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary malicious code in the context of a user running an application that uses the affected library. Failed exploit attempts will likely crash the application.

LibTIFF 3.8.2 is vulnerable; other versions may be affected as well.
