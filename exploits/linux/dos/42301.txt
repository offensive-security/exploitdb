The place of Out of bound read:

ret_val = 0;
for (i = 0; i < td->td_customValueCount; i++) {
    TIFFTagValue *tv = td->td_customValues + i;

if (tv->info->field_tag != tag)
                        continue;

The place of Out of bound read:

The 1072 line of tif_dir.c

1068     ret_val = 0;
1069     for (i = 0; i < td->td_customValueCount; i++) {
1070             TIFFTagValue *tv = td->td_customValues + i;
1071
1072             if (tv->info->field_tag != tag)
1073                     continue;

As tv increased in 1070, Out of bound read happened in 1072 when the pointer tv
was referenced.

PoC:

Detailed information of the bug can be reproduced using the valgrind tool:

# valgrind tiffsplit $File(the testcase in the attachment)
