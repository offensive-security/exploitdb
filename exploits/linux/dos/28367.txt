AlsaPlayer is prone to multiple buffer-overflow vulnerabilities because the application fails to check the size of the data before copying it into a finite-sized internal memory buffer.

An attacker can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application or cause a denial-of-service condition.

AlsaPlayer 0.99.76, the CVS version as of 9 Aug 2006, and prior versions are vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
