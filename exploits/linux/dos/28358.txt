The Linux kernel is susceptible to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because the EXT3 filesystem code fails to properly handle unexpected conditions.

Remote attackers may trigger this issue by sending crafted UDP datagrams to affected computers that are configured as NFS servers, causing filesystem errors. Depending on the mount-time options of affected filesystems, this may result in remounting filesystems as read-only or cause a kernel panic.

Linux kernel versions 2.6.14.4, 2.6.17.6, and 2.6.17.7 are vulnerable to this issue; other versions in the 2.6 series are also likely affected.
