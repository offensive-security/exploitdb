Linux Kernel is reported prone to a local denial-of-service vulnerability. This issue arises from a failure to properly unregister kernel resources when network devices are removed.

This issue allows local attackers to deny service to legitimate users. Attackers may also be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel, but this has not been confirmed.

/* The criticial is fairly simple to raise : the infinite loop occurs when
 * calling bind with no speficied port number (ie zero), if and only if the
 * IPv6 stack cannot find any free UDP port within the local port range
 * (normally 32768-61000). Because this requires times more sockets than what
 * a process normally can open at a given time, we have to spawn several
 * processes. Then, the simplest way to trigger the crash condition consists
 * of opening up kernel-allocated UDP ports until it crashes, but that is
 * fairly slow (because allocation are stored in small a hash table of lists,
 * that are checked at each allocation). A much faster scheme involves getting
 * the local port range from /proc, allocating one by one, and only then, ask
 * for automatic (any/zero) port allocation.
