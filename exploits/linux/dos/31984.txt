Mozilla Firefox is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability.

Successful exploits can allow attackers to crash the affected browser, resulting in denial-of-service conditions.

This issue affects Firefox 3 running on Ubuntu Linux 8.04; other versions running on different platforms may also be affected.
