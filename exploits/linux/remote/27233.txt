SAP Business Connector is prone to a file-access/deletion vulnerability. This issue arises due to an access-validation error.

A successful attack will result in the disclosure of sensitive or privileged information. An attacker may also delete arbitrary files. This often occurs with superuser privileges, since the package is often run with elevated privileges to gain access to TCP ports lower than 1024.
