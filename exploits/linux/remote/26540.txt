Inkscape is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to do proper bounds checking on user-supplied data before copying it into a finite sized buffer.

When the application processes a malformed SVG image file, it results in a buffer overflow. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim user.
