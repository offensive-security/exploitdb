It is reported that rtf2latex2e is susceptible to a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly bounds check user-supplied image data prior to copying it into a fixed-size memory buffer.

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to alter the proper flow of execution of the application, potentially resulting in the execution of attacker-supplied machine code in the context of the application attempting to read the malicious RTF file.
