It has been reported that a buffer overflow in escputil exists. When supplied with excessively long arguments, it is possible to overwrite stack memory.

escputil is reportedly installed setgid 'sys' on Mandrake Linux, so it is possible that this issue may be exploited to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Other distributions may also be affected if the utility is installed or runs with elevated privileges.
