# /sbin/restore exploit for rh6.2
#
# I did not find this weakness my self, all i did was
# writing this script (and some more) to make it
# automatic and easy to use.
#
# This exploit should work on all redhat 6.2 systems
# with /sbin/restore not "fucked up". May work on other
# distros too, but only tested successfully on rh6.2.
#
# Make sure that the $USER variable is set! If you aren't
# sure, do a SET USER=<your-login-name> before you start
# the exploit!
#
# Please do NOT remove this header from the file.
