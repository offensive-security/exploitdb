# OSH 1.7 Exploit
#
# EDUCATIONAL purposes only.... :-)
#
# by Charles Stevenson (core) <core@bokeoa.com>
#
# Description:
# The Operator Shell (Osh) is a setuid root, security enhanced, restricted
# shell. It allows the administrator to carefully limit the access of special
# commands and files to the users whose duties require their use, while
# at the same time automatically maintaining audit records. The configuration
# file for Osh contains an administrator defined access profile for each
# authorized user or group.
#
# Problem:
# The patch for the overflows published by Steve Kemp seems lacking. If the
# following requirements are met we can overflow within the iopen() function:
# osh must be invoked in non-interactive mode, argv[1] must be a valid command
# according to /etc/osh.conf (e.g. osh help $(perl -e 'print "A"x8192')). The
# offending code can be found at main.c:305
#
#    if (found) { /* It's a command, input is a string */
#      inputfp=(FILE *)1;
#      strcpy(inputstring, argv[1]); //XXX: command is copied into inputstring
#      for (i=3;i<=argc;i++) {
#	strcat(inputstring, " "); //XXX: it adds a space
#	strcat(inputstring, argv[i-1]); //XXX: and now overflow is possible
#      }
#      strcat(inputstring, "\n"); /* So it's a command */
#
# So far so good. Looking at the declaration `static char inputstring[1024];'
# we can see that overflow is indeed possible. Here's the layout of memory:
#
#+------------------------------+

# Table stores a bunch of function pointers to all the routines whether
# internally implemented or called via execv. So I decided to try and
# overwrite the first entry with the address of my shellcode. There were
# several obstacles in between me and my rootshell though. First was a
# loop that performed strcmp's on AliasList items. Rather than fill that
# out I found that I could conveniently set AliasCounter to -1 and skip
# the loop entirely. Next I found that if argv[1] was a builtin command
# and NUMENTRY was a positive integer I could set Table[0].prog_name to match
# argv[1] and it'd call Table[0].handler (So I found "exit" in the executable
# itself thanks to `static struct hand Internal[]'). From main.c:1032
#
#  while (i<NUMENTRY)
#    if (strcmp(Table[++i].prog_name,argv[0])==0)
#      { found=1; break; }
#  ...
#  if (strcmp(Table[i].prog_name, "exit")==0) {
#    (*(Table[i].handler))(argc, argv);
#    return(-2);
#  }
#
# I also point Table[0].path to the NULL at the end of "exit" to prevent a
# crash. Finally there is a check @ line 256 in main.c which attempts to
# prevent overflow that can be circumvented, my choice was the ampersand due
# to the way select statement works:
#
#             while ((c != EOF) && (c != ';') && (c != '&') && (c != '|')
#                    && (c != '<') && (c != '>') && (c != '\n') && (c != ' ')
#                    && (c != '\t'))
#               c = pgetc();
#             if (c != EOF)
#               pungetc(c,inputfp);
#             return TTOOLONG;
#
# Risk: Medium since user would have to be in the operator group which
#       the admin would have to grant explicitly and I assume would be
#       a trustworthy individual ;-)
#
# Solution:
# apt-get --purge remove osh

#
# Coming out of retirement slowly but surely... damn I'm rusty...
# who's got some WD40? BSS overflow... mmmhmmm...
#
# ??/??/02 - First exploited OSH but though no one used it
#            and just recently realised it was in Debian
#            except they had patched the environment holes.
#            References: CAN-2003-0452, BugTraq IDs: 7992, 7993
# 02/03/05 - PoC causes logout() to record bogus username
# 02/05/05 - FF rootshell!! h0h0h0!
#
# I still find it hard to imagine that anyone would use osh
# The code is basically beyond repair. Sudo is better.... :-)
#
# Don't forget to clean /var/log/osh.log
