Linuxconf is a Linux configuration utility from Solucorp. It is typically installed as a setuid root utility for the management and configuration of Linux operating systems.

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported for Linuxconf. The vulnerability is due to insufficent bounds checking of the LINUXCONF_LANG environment variable. An attacker who sets the LINUXCONF_LANG environment variable with an overly large string will be able to cause the buffer overflow condition.
