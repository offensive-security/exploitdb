X41 D-Sec GmbH Security Advisory: X41-2017-010

Command Execution in Shadowsocks-libev
======================================

Overview
--------
Severity Rating: High
Confirmed Affected Versions: 3.1.0
Confirmed Patched Versions: N/A
Vendor: Shadowsocks
Vendor URL: https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev
Vector: Local

Status: Public
CVE: not yet assigned
Advisory-URL:

Summary and Impact
------------------
Shadowsocks-libev offers local command execution per configuration file
or/and additionally, code execution per UDP request on 127.0.0.1.

The configuration file on the file system or the JSON configuration
received via UDP request is parsed and the arguments are passed to the
"add_server" function.
The function calls "construct_command_line(manager, server);" which
returns a string from the parsed configuration.
The string gets executed at line 486 "if (system(cmd) == -1) {", so if a
configuration parameter contains "||evil command&&" within the "method"
parameter, the evil command will get executed.

The ss-manager uses UDP port 8830 to get control commands on 127.0.0.1.
By default no authentication is required, although a password can be set
with the '-k' parameter.


Product Description
-------------------
Shadowsocks-libev is a lightweight secured SOCKS5 proxy for embedded
devices and low-end boxes. The ss-manager is meant to control
Shadowsocks servers for multiple users, it spawns new servers if needed.

It is a port of Shadowsocks created by @clowwindy, and maintained by
@madeye and @linusyang.


Proof of Concept
----------------
As passed configuration requests are getting executed, the following command
will create file "evil" in /tmp/ on the server:

nc -u 127.0.0.1 8839
    add: {"server_port":8003, "password":"test", "method":"||touch
/tmp/evil||"}

The code is executed through shadowsocks-libev/src/manager.c.
If the configuration file on the file system is manipulated, the code
would get executed as soon as a Shadowsocks instance is started from
ss-manage, as long as the malicious part of the configuration has not
been overwritten.


Workarounds
-----------
There is no workaround available, do not use ss-manage until a patch is
released.
