The configuration files for the RealOne Player are installed in the a hidden folder in a users home directory. The issue presents itself, because configuration files stored in this directory are installed with insecure permissions. This means that an attacker, who is in the same group as a target user, may modify RealOne Player configuration files and may thereby escalate privileges to that of the target user.

/**
 * rp9-priv-esc.c
 *
 * A local privilege escalation attack against the community supported
 * version of Real.com's Realplayer, version 9.
 *
 * Written by:
 *
 * 	Jon Hart <warchild@spoofed.org>
 *
 * By default, configuration files are stored in ~$USER/.realnetworks/,
 * but all the files in there are group writeable.  So long as ~$USER
 * has group execution permissions (which is pretty common), a malicious
 * local user can edit the config files of fellow users to do his biddings.
 *
 * There are a number of ways to attack this, but after some poking it seems
 * that modifying the path to shared libraries and writing my own malicious
 * shared libraries was the easiest.
 *
 * (as an aside, just because the shared libraries in the directories contained
 * in ~$USER/.realnetworks/RealShared_0_0/ are stripped doesn't mean we can't get
 * the symbols back.  objdump quickly can tell us what the names of the 15
 * functions are, and we can stub out a bogus shared library pretty quickly.)
 *
 * This particular bit of code is meant to replace the shared library
 * cook.so.6.0, which is contained in the Codecs directory.  To execute this
 * attack against a fellow local user, first edit their config file
 * (~victim/.realnetworks/RealShared_0_0) to have the 'dt_codecs' variable
 * point to a directory under your control, like /tmp/Codecs.  Copy all of the
 * existing files from the previous value of dt_codecs (which is usually something
 * like ~victim/Real/Codecs/) to /tmp/Codecs.  Next, compile the code below as a
 * shared library and copy it to the trojaned directory:
 *
 *
 * `gcc -shared -fPIC -o /tmp/Codecs/cook.so.6.0 rp9-priv-esc.c`
 *
 *	The next time the victim fires up realplayer 9, a nice little shell
 * will be listening on port 12345 for you:
 *
 * guest@haiti:/$ id
 * uid=1006(guest) gid=100(users) groups=100(users)
 * guest@haiti:/$ nc localhost 12345
 * id
 * uid=1000(warchild) gid=100(users) groups=100(users),40(src),1003(wheel)
 *
 * Of course, you don't have to execute a shell.  Do whatever makes you happy.
 *
 * Fix?  `chmod 700 ~/.realnetworks/*`
