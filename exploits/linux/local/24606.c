Sudo is reported prone to an information disclosure vulnerability.

This vulnerability presents itself when sudo is called with the '-e' option, or the 'sudoedit' command is invoked. In certain circumstances, attackers may access the contents of arbitrary files with superuser privileges.

Version 1.6.8 is reported susceptible to this vulnerability.

How do I use this code ?

To exploit sudoedit you have to open with it the
file "rosiello" as shown in the example.

EXAMPLE SCENARIO:

1) Open two shells (i) and (ii);
2) (i)$sudoedit rosiello;
3) (ii)$./sudoedit-exploit /etc/shadow;
4) (i) close sudoedit.

The file "rosiello" is now a copy of "/etc/shadow".
