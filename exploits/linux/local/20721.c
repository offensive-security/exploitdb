The Linux kernel is the core of all distributions of the Linux Operating System. It was originally written by Linus Torvalds, and is maintained by a community of developers.

A problem in the Linux Kernel could make it possible for a local user to gain elevated privileges. A problem with the checking of process tracing on programs attempting to execute other programs that are setuid or setgid. It is possible to trace a process after it has entered a setuid or setgid execution state.

This makes it possible for a local user to change parts of the process as they function, and potentially gain elevated privileges.

/*
 * epcs2 (improved by lst [liquid@dqc.org])
 * ~~~~~~~
 * exploit for execve/ptrace race condition in Linux kernel up to 2.2.18
 *
 * originally by:
 * (c) 2001 Wojciech Purczynski / cliph / <wp@elzabsoft.pl>
 *
 * improved by:
 * lst [liquid@dqc.org]
 *
 * This sploit does _not_ use brute force. It does not need that.
 * It does only one attemt to sploit the race condition in execve.
 * Parent process waits for a context-switch that occur after
 * child task sleep in execve.
 *
 * It should work even on openwall-patched kernels (I haven't tested it).
 *
 * Compile it:
 *	cc epcs.c -o epcs
 * Usage:
 *	./epcs [victim]
 *
 * It gives instant root shell with any of a suid binaries.
 *
 * If it does not work, try use some methods to ensure that execve
 * would sleep while loading binary file into memory,
 *
 * 	i.e.: cat /usr/lib/* >/dev/null 2>&1
 *
 * Tested on RH 7.0 and RH 6.2 / 2.2.14 / 2.2.18 / 2.2.18ow4
 * This exploit does not work on 2.4.x because kernel won't set suid
 * privileges if user ptraces a binary.
 * But it is still exploitable on these kernels.
 *
 * Thanks to Bulba (he made me to take a look at this bug ;) )
 * Greetings to SigSegv team.
 *
 * -- d00t
 * improved by lst [liquid@dqc.org]
 * props to kevin for most of the work
 *
 * now works on stack non-exec systems with some neat trickery for the automated
 * method, ie. no need to find the bss segment via objdump
 *
 * particularly it now rewrites the code instruction sets in the
 * dynamic linker _start segment and continues execution from there.
 *
 * an aside, due to the fact that the code self-modified, it wouldnt work
 * quite correctly on a stack non-exec system without playing directly with
 * the bss segment (ie no regs.eip = regs.esp change).  this is much more
 * automated.  however, do note that the previous version did not trigger stack
 * non-exec warnings due to how it was operating.  note that the regs.eip = regs.esp
 * method will break on stack non-exec systems.
 *
 * as always.. enjoy.
