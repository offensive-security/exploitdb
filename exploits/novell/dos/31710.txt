Novell GroupWise is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability and a denial-of-service vulnerability.

By exploiting the HTML-injection vulnerability, attackers can execute HTML and script code in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing them to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

By exploiting the denial-of-service vulnerability, attackers can crash the application.

Novell GroupWise 7 is vulnerable to these issues; other versions may also be affected.
