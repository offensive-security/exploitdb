Screen to Screen is a remote control utility for systems runnig MacOS. To use it, you need to have an administrator password. This password is stored in encrypted form in a file called "Authorization" located in the System Folder under Preferences:Power On Preferences:Screen To Screen.

There are two problems:
1: The file can be deleted, and then the next time Screen to Screen is started it will reset the username to 'administrator' and the password to 'admin'.
2: The encryption scheme is weak and can be broken.

This program, written by mSec, will decrypt the administrator password for Screen to Screen.
