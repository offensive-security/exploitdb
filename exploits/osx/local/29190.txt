Apple Mac OS X is prone to a local integer-overflow vulnerability. This issue occurs when the operating system fails to handle specially crafted binaries.

A successful exploit would allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with kernel-level privileges, leading to the complete compromise of affected computers. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.
