Foxit Reader 4.1.1 is subject to a stack overflow vulnerability when parsing overly long unicode titles resulting in a SEH overwrite.
The included PoC results in a SEH overwrite. The exception must be passed twice in order to reach the overwritten handler.
This vulnerability was reported to the vendor and was patched in Foxit Reader 4.2.
