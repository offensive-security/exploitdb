IOUserClient subclasses which override IOUserClient::externalMethod need to ensure that if they return
kIOReturnSuccess they actually take ownership of the mach_port_t asyncWakePort if they are called via
IOConnectCallAsyncMethod.

If the userclient code doesn't take ownership of the mach port and returns a success code MIG assumes that
they did take ownership and won't release it's reference on the port. This leads to a reference count leak.

See the previous bug for more in-depth discussion.

This PoC targets IOSurface which was just the first userclient I looked at; I imagine more are vulnerable.
This PoC takes about an hour on 4 core MacBookPro to trigger the kernel UaF.
