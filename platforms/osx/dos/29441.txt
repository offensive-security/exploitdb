Apple Mac OS X is prone to a remote integer-overflow vulnerability. This issue occurs when the UFS filesystem handler fails to handle specially crafted DMG images.

A successful exploit can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with kernel-level privileges, leading to the complete compromise of affected computers. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

Mac OS X 10.4.8 and freeBSD 6.1 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
