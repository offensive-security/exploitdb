II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------

MySQL:

"MySQL is the world's most popular open source database.
Whether you are a fast growing web property, technology ISV or large
enterprise, MySQL can cost-effectively help you deliver high performance,
scalable database applications."

"Many of the world's largest and fastest-growing organizations including
Facebook, Google, Adobe, Alcatel Lucent and Zappos rely on MySQL to save time
and money powering their high-volume Web sites, business-critical systems and
packaged software."

MariaDB:

"MariaDB is one of the most popular database servers in the world. 
Itâ€™s made by the original developers of MySQL and guaranteed to stay open source. 
Notable users include Wikipedia, WordPress.com and Google.

MariaDB turns data into structured information in a wide array of applications, 
ranging from banking to websites. It is an enhanced, drop-in replacement for MySQL. 
MariaDB is used because it is fast, scalable and robust, with a rich ecosystem of 
storage engines, plugins and many other tools make it very versatile for a wide 
variety of use cases."

PerconaDB:

"Percona Server for MySQL is a free, fully compatible, enhanced, open source 
drop-in replacement for MySQL that provides superior performance, scalability 
and instrumentation. 
With over 3,000,000 downloads, Percona Serverâ€™s self-tuning algorithms and support
for extremely high-performance hardware delivers excellent performance and reliability."

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

MySQL-based databases including MySQL, MariaDB and PerconaDB are affected
by a privilege escalation vulnerability which can let attackers who have
gained access to mysql system user to further escalate their privileges
to root user allowing them to fully compromise the system.
The vulnerability stems from unsafe file handling of error logs and
other files.


IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

The error.log file on most default installations of MySQL/PerconaDB/MariaDB
databases is stored either in /var/log/mysql or /var/lib/mysql directory.

The permissions on the file and directory look as follows:

root@trusty:/var/lib/mysql# ls -la /var/log/mysql
total 468
drwxr-s---  2 mysql adm      4096 Sep 11 06:25 .
drwxrwxr-x 36 root  syslog   4096 Sep 11 06:25 ..
-rw-r-----  1 mysql adm         0 Sep 11 06:25 error.log

root@trusty:/var/lib/mysql# ls -lad /var/log/mysql
drwxr-s--- 2 mysql adm 4096 Sep 11 06:25 /var/log/mysql


mysqld_safe wrapper that is normally used for starting MySQL daemon and 
creating/reopening the error.log performs certain unsafe file operations that
may allow attackers to gain root privileges.

The wrapper script contains a 'while' loop shown below which monitors the mysqld 
process and performs a restart in case of the process failure.  
The restart involves re-creation of the error.log file if syslog logging has
not been configured instead of error log files (file-based logging is the 
default setting on most installations).


--------[ mysqld_safe ]--------
[...]

while true
do
  rm -f "$pid_file"     # Some extra safety

  start_time=`date +%M%S`

  eval_log_error "$cmd"

  if [ $want_syslog -eq 0 -a ! -f "$err_log" ]; then
    touch "$err_log"                    # hypothetical: log was renamed but not
    chown $user "$err_log"              # flushed yet. we'd recreate it with
    chmod "$fmode" "$err_log"           # wrong owner next time we log, so set
  fi                                    # it up correctly while we can!

[...]

-------------------------------

As can be seen, the error.log file is created (touch) and chowned to the user
running the mysqld daemon (typically 'mysql'). 

The operation is vulnerable to a symlink attack.

Attackers who obtained access to mysql account for example through CVE-2016-6663
vulnerability described at:

http://legalhackers.com/advisories/MySQL-MariaDB-PerconaDB-PrivEsc-Race-CVE-2016-6663-OCVE-2016-5616-Exploit.html

would gain access to /var/log or /var/lib/mysql directories (owned by mysql user) 
and could therefore easily remove the error.log file and replace it 
with a symlink to an arbitrary system file which would result in creating in
arbitrary file on the system with mysql privileges and could be used to escalate
privileges.

The privilege escalation could be triggered instantly (without the need to wait
for mysql service restart/reboot) by attackers having 'mysql' account by simply 
killing the mysqld child process (launched by the mysqld_safe wrapper).

When the mysqld process gets terminated, the wrapper will then re-itertate the 
loop shown above and immediately create a mysql-owned file in the location 
specified by the attacker in the symlink thus allowing attackers to quickly
escalate their privileges.

#
# MySQL / MariaDB / PerconaDB - Root Privilege Escalation PoC Exploit
# mysql-chowned.sh (ver. 1.0)
#
# CVE-2016-6664 / OCVE-2016-5617
#
# Discovered and coded by:
#
# Dawid Golunski
# dawid[at]legalhackers.com
#
# http://legalhackers.com
#
#
# This PoC exploit allows attackers to (instantly) escalate their privileges
# from mysql system account to root through unsafe error log handling.
# The exploit requires that file-based logging has been configured (default).
# To confirm that syslog logging has not been enabled instead use:
# grep -r syslog /etc/mysql
# which should return no results.
#
# This exploit can be chained with the following vulnerability:
# CVE-2016-6663 / OCVE-2016-5616
# which allows attackers to gain access to mysql system account (mysql shell).
#
# In case database server has been configured with syslog you may also use:
# CVE-2016-6662 as an alternative to this exploit.
#
# Usage:
# ./mysql-chowned.sh path_to_error.log
