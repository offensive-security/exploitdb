GNU UnRTF is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is exposed when the program converts RTF font table data. Since RTF documents may originate from an external or untrusted source, this vulnerability is considered to be remote in nature.

Successful exploitation will result in execution of arbitrary code.
